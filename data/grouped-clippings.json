[{"title":"Think Like a Monk: The secret of how to harness the power of positivity and be happy now","author":"Jay Shetty","highlights":["“ignorance,” “impulsivity,” and “goodness.” I have found that these three modes can be applied to any activity—for example, when you pull back from a conflict and look for understanding, it’s very useful to try to shift from rajas—impulsivity and passion—to sattva—goodness, positivity,","Forgiveness has been shown to bring peace to our minds. Forgiveness actually conserves energy. Transformational forgiveness is linked to a slew of health improvements including: fewer medications taken, better sleep quality,","List all the ways you think the other person did you wrong. Forgiving another person honestly and specifically goes a long way toward healing the relationship. Start each item with “I forgive you for…” Keep going until you get everything out. We’re not sending this letter, so you can repeat yourself if the same thing keeps coming to mind. Write everything you wanted to say but never had a chance. You don’t have to feel forgiveness. Yet. When you write it down, what you’re doing is beginning to understand the pain more specifically so that you can slowly let it go. Acknowledge your own shortcomings. What was your role, if any, in the situation or conflict? List the ways you feel you did wrong, starting each with the phrase “Please forgive me for …” Remember you can’t undo the past, but taking responsibility for your role will help you understand and let go of your anger toward yourself and the other person. When you are done with this letter, record yourself reading it. (Most phones can do this.) Play it back, putting yourself in the position of the objective observer. Remember that the pain inflicted on you isn’t yours. It’s the other person’s pain. When you squeeze an orange, you get orange juice. When you squeeze someone full of pain, pain comes out. Instead of absorbing it or giving it back, if you forgive, you help diffuse the pain.","TRY THIS: FORGIVE YOURSELF The exercise above can also be used to forgive yourself. Starting each line with “I forgive myself for … ,” list the reasons you feel angry at or disappointed in yourself. Then read it out loud or record it and play it for yourself. Bring out the objective observer, and find understanding for yourself, letting go of the pain.","TRY THIS: AUDIT YOUR NEGATIVE COMMENTS. Keep a tally of the negative remarks you make over the course of a week. See if you can make your daily number go down. The goal is zero.","Complainers, like the friend on the phone, who complain endlessly without looking for solutions. Life is a problem that will be hard if not impossible to solve. Cancellers, who take a compliment and spin it: “You look good today” becomes “You mean I looked bad yesterday?” Casualties, who think the world is against them and blame their problems on others. Critics, who judge others for either having a different opinion or not having one, for any choices they’ve made that are different from what the critic would have done. Commanders, who realize their own limits but pressure others to succeed. They’ll say, “You never have time for me,” even though they’re busy as well. Competitors, who compare themselves to others, controlling and manipulating to make themselves or their choices look better. They are in so much pain that they want to bring others down. Often we have to play down our successes around these people because we know they can’t appreciate them. Controllers, who monitor and try to direct how their friends or partners spend time, and with whom, and what choices they make.","TRY THIS: COMPANION AUDIT Over the course of a week, make a list of the people with whom you spend the most time. List the values that you share next to each person. Are you giving the most time to the people who align most closely with your values?","TRY THIS: PAST VALUES Reflect on the three best and three worst choices you’ve ever made. Why did you make them? What have you learned? How would you have done it differently?","According to the Gita, these are the higher values and qualities: fearlessness, purity of mind, gratitude, service and charity, acceptance, performing sacrifice, deep study, austerity, straightforwardness, nonviolence, truthfulness, absence of anger, renunciation, perspective, restraint from fault finding, compassion toward all living beings, satisfaction, gentleness/kindness, integrity, determination.","The six lower values are greed, lust, anger, ego, illusion, and envy.","TRY THIS: WHERE DID YOUR VALUES COME FROM? It can be hard to perceive the effect these casual influences have on us. Values are abstract, elusive, and the world we live in constantly pushes blatant and subliminal suggestions as to what we should want, and how we should live, and how we form our ideas of who we are. Write down some of the values that shape your life. Next to each, write the origin. Put a checkmark next to each value that you truly share.","We have so much to offer the world, but fear and anxiety disconnect us from our abilities. This is because growing up we were taught, directly or indirectly, that fear is negative.","fear isn’t bad; it’s simply a warning flag—your mind saying “This doesn’t look good! Something might go wrong!” It’s what we do with that signal that matters.","What am I really scared of? Then I start to delve into fear around the times when I’d gotten in trouble at school. I was so worried that I would be suspended or expelled. How would my parents react? What would my teachers think? I invite myself to go even deeper. What am I really scared of? I see this fear around my parents—of them not getting along and of me, at a young age, trying to mediate their marriage. Of thinking, How can I please both of them? How can I manage them and make sure they’re happy? That’s when I find the root of my fear.","We fear the stresses and challenges of change, but those stresses and challenges are the wind that makes us stronger.","That was our first acknowledgment of our relationship with fear, to breathe in and repeat, “I see you, my pain. I see you, my fear,” and as we breathed out, we said, “I see you and I’m here with you. I see you and I am here for you.”","TRY THIS: RATE YOUR FEAR Draw a line with zero at one end and ten at the other. What’s the worst thing you can imagine? Maybe it’s a paralyzing injury or losing a loved one. Make that a ten on the line. Now rate your current fear in relation to that one. Just doing this helps give some perspective. When you feel fear crop up, rate it. Where does it fall next to something that’s truly scary?","A powerful question to ask your fear (again, with kindness and sincerity, as many times as necessary) is “When do I feel you?”","the fear always led me to the same concern: how I was perceived by others. What would they think of me? My root fear influences my decision-making. That awareness now prompts me when I reach a decisive moment to take a closer look and ask myself, “Is this decision influenced by how others will perceive me?” In this way, I can use my awareness of my fear as a tool to help me make decisions that are truly in line with my values and purpose.","Clinging to temporary things gives them power over us, and they become sources of pain and fear. But when we accept the temporary nature of everything in our lives, we can feel gratitude for the good fortune of getting to borrow them for a time.","transform hurtful fears into useful fears by focusing on what we can control. We can’t stop our parents from dying, but we use the fear to remind us to spend more time with them.","TRY THIS: AUDIT YOUR ATTACHMENTS Ask yourself: “What am I afraid of losing?” Start with the externals: Is it your car, your house, your looks? Write down everything you think of. Now think about the internals: your reputation, your status, your sense of belonging? Write those down too. These combined lists are likely to be the greatest sources of pain in your life—your fear of having these things taken away. Now start thinking about changing your mental relationship with those things so that you are less attached to them. Remember—you can still fully love and enjoy your partner, your children, your home, your money, from a space of nonattachment. It’s about understanding and accepting that all things are temporary and that we can’t truly own or control anything, so that we can fully appreciate these things and they can enhance our life rather than be a source of griping and fear. What better way to accept that children eventually go off to live their own lives and call you once a week, if you’re lucky?","When you panic, you start to anticipate outcomes that have not yet come to pass. Fear makes us fiction writers. We start with a premise, an idea, a fear—what will happen if … Then we spiral off, devising possible future scenarios.","continuing story, not just disconnected pieces. When you are hired for a job, take a moment to reflect on all the lost jobs and/or failed interviews that led to this victory. You can think of them as necessary challenges along the way. When we learn to stop segmenting experiences and periods of our life and instead see them as scenes and acts in a larger narrative, we gain perspective that helps us deal with fear.","TRY THIS: EXPAND THE MOMENT Think of something great that happened to you. Perhaps it was the birth of a child or getting that new job you wanted. Let yourself feel that joy for a moment. Now rewind to the events that occurred just before it. What was going on in your life before the birth of your child or before you were selected for that job? Perhaps it was months and months of trying unsuccessfully to conceive or being rejected from three other jobs you’d applied for. Now try to see that narrative as a whole story—a progression from the bad to the good. Open yourself to the idea that perhaps what happened during the challenging time was actually clearing the way for what you’re now celebrating, or made you feel even happier about the experience that came after it. Now take a moment to express gratitude for those challenges and weave them into the story of your life.","He says, “Think about your motivations. Do you want to memorize all of the scripture because it’s an impressive achievement, or do you want the experience of having studied it? In the first, all you want is the outcome. In the second, you are curious about what you might learn from the process.”","Fear. Thakura describes this as being driven by “sickness, poverty, fear of hell or fear of death.” Desire. Seeking personal gratification through success, wealth, and pleasure. Duty. Motivated by gratitude, responsibility, and the desire to do the right thing. Love. Compelled by care for others and the urge to help them.","The problem with fear is that it’s not sustainable. When we operate in fear for a long time, we can’t work to the best of our abilities. We are too worried about getting the wrong result. We become frantic or paralyzed and are unable to evaluate our situations objectively or to take risks.","Success is earning money, being respected in your work, executing projects smoothly, receiving accolades. Happiness is feeling good about yourself, having close relationships, making the world a better place.","To live intentionally, we must dig to the deepest why behind the want. This requires pausing to think not only about why we want something, but also who we are or need to be to get it, and whether being that person appeals to us.","TRY THIS: A QUESTION MEDITATION Take a desire you have and ask yourself why you want it. Keep asking until you get to the root intention. Common answers are: To look and feel good Security Service Growth","But if our intentions are vengeful or self-motivated, we grow weeds. Weeds usually grow from ego, greed, envy, anger, pride, competition, or stress.","We never say, “I wish I could be more organized and focused and could do the hard work to get that.” We don’t vocalize what it would actually take to get what we want. “I wish” is code for “I don’t want to do anything differently.”","Once you know the why behind the want, consider the work behind the want. What will it take to get the nice house and the fancy car?","TRY THIS: ADD TO-BE’S TO YOUR TO-DO’S Alongside your to-do list, try making a to-be list. The good news is you’re not making your list longer—these are not items you can check off or complete—but the exercise is a reminder that achieving your goals with intention means living up to the values that drive those goals.","And if you have a clear and confident sense of why you took each step, then you are more resilient. Failure doesn’t mean you’re worthless—it means you must look for another route to achieving worthwhile goals. Satisfaction comes from believing in the value of what you do.","Find a comfortable position—sitting in a chair, sitting upright with a cushion, or lying down Close your eyes Lower your gaze (yes, you can do this with your eyes closed) Make yourself comfortable in this position Roll back your shoulders Bring your awareness to            Calm            Balance            Ease            Stillness            Peace            Whenever your mind wanders just gently and softly bring it back to            Calm            Balance            Ease            Stillness            Peace Now become aware of your natural breathing pattern. Don’t force or pressure your breath, just become aware of your natural breathing pattern. At the ashram we were taught to use diaphragmatic breathing. To do so, place one hand on your stomach and the other on your chest, and:            Breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth            When you inhale, feel your stomach expand (as opposed to your chest)            When you exhale, feel your stomach contract            Continue this in your own pace, at your own time            When you inhale, feel that you are taking in positive, uplifting energy            When you exhale, feel that you are releasing any negative, toxic energy Lower your left ear to your left shoulder as you breathe in … and bring it back to the middle as you breathe out. Lower your right ear to your right shoulder as you breathe in … and bring it back to the middle as you breathe out. Really feel the breath, with no rush or force, in your own pace, at your own time","I find studies by Albert Mehrabian showing that 55 percent of our communication is conveyed by body language, 38 percent is tone of voice, and a mere 7 percent is the actual words we speak.","Passion + Expertise + Usefulness = Dharma. If we’re only excited when people say nice things about our work, it’s a sign that we’re not passionate about the work itself. And if we indulge our interests and skills, but nobody responds to them, then our passion is without purpose. If either piece is missing, we’re not living our dharma.","Quadrants of Potential that we should be spending as much time as possible at the upper right, in Quadrant Two: doing things that we’re both good at and love.","“job crafting” to describe “what employees do to redesign their own jobs in ways that foster engagement at work, job satisfaction, resilience, and thriving.”","TRY THIS: IDENTIFY YOUR QUADRANT OF POTENTIAL You may have been doing this exercise in your head as you read about the Quadrants of Potential. Nonetheless, I want you to go through the exercise of acknowledging how close you are to living your dharma today.            Do you like your job?            Do you love your job?            Are you good at your job?            Do other people need and appreciate your work?            Is your greatest skill or passion outside your work?            What is it?            Do you dream of making it your work?            Do you think this is an attainable dream?            Do you think there might be ways you could bring your passion to your work?            Write down any ideas you","A Guide, as you will see here, is compelled to learn and share knowledge—you could be a teacher or a writer. A Leader likes to influence and provide, but that doesn’t mean you have to be a CEO or a lieutenant—you could be a school principal or shop manager. A Creator likes to make things happen—this could be at a start-up or in a neighborhood association. A Maker likes to see things tangibly being built—they could be a coder or a nurse.","TRY THIS: REFLECTED BEST-SELF EXERCISE Choose a group of people who know you well—a diverse mix of people you’ve worked with, family, and friends. As few as three will work, but ten to twenty is even better. Ask them to write down a moment when you were at your best. Ask them to be specific. Look for patterns and common themes. Write out a profile of yourself, aggregating the feedback as if it weren’t about you. Think about how you can turn your best skills into action. How can you use those skills this weekend? In different circumstances or with different people?","First, when you visualize yourself in a process, do you feel joy? Does the idea of it appeal to you? Then, when you actually do the activity, how does your body respond? When you’re in your element, you can feel it.","I woke to the sounds of nature. At last I came to understand the value in it. The point of waking up early wasn’t to torture us—it was to start the day off with peace and tranquility.","Thankfulness. Express gratitude to someone, some place, or something every day. This includes thinking it, writing it, and sharing it. (See Chapter Nine.)            Insight. Gain insight through reading the paper or a book, or listening to a podcast.            Meditation. Spend fifteen minutes alone, breathing, visualizing or with sound. (More about sound meditation at the end of Part 3.)            Exercise. We monks did yoga, but you can do some basic stretches or a workout.","As much as 75 percent of the HGH in our bodies is released when we sleep, and research shows that our highest bursts of HGH typically come between 10 p.m. and midnight, so if you’re awake during those hours, you’re cheating yourself of HGH.","Kevin O’Leary said that before he goes to sleep he writes down three things he wants to do the next morning before he talks to anyone besides his family.","Every night when I’m falling asleep, I say to myself, “I am relaxed, energized, and focused. I am calm, enthusiastic, and productive.”","TRY THIS: VISUALIZATION FOR TOMORROW Just as an inventor has to visualize an idea before building it, we can visualize the life we want, beginning by visualizing how we want our mornings to be. After you do breathwork to calm your mind, I want you to visualize yourself as your best self. Visualize yourself waking up in the morning healthy, well rested, and energized. Imagine the sunlight coming through the windows. You get up, and as your feet touch the ground, you feel a sense of gratitude for another day. Really feel that gratitude, and then say in your mind, “I am grateful for today. I am excited for today. I am joyful for today.”","Spotting something new every day on our familiar walk was a reminder to keep our focus on that walk, to see the freshness in each “routine,” to be aware.","Kālidāsa, the great Sanskrit writer of the fifth century, wrote, “Yesterday is but a dream. Tomorrow is only a vision. But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”","A desired distraction at work bleeds into unwanted distraction on vacation. Distraction at lunch bleeds into the afternoon. We are training our minds to be where we physically aren’t. If you allow yourself to daydream, you will always be distracted. Being present is the only way to live a truly rich and full life.","TRY THIS: ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS For every environment where you spend time this week, ask yourself the following questions. If possible, ask them right after the experience, then again at the end of the week.            What were the key features of the space?            Quiet or loud?            Big or small?            Vibrant or plain?            In the center of an active space or removed?            Close to other people or isolated?            How did I feel in this space: productive? relaxed? distracted?            Did the activity I was doing fit well with the place where I was doing it?            Was I in the best mindset for what I set out to do?            If not, is there another place where I am more comfortable accomplishing what I planned?","Location has energy; time has memory. If you do something at the same time every day, it becomes easier and natural. If you do something in the same space every day, it becomes easier and natural.","‘Every choice in life is a battle between two wolves inside us. One represents anger, envy, greed, fear, lies, insecurity, and ego. The other represents peace, love, compassion, kindness, humility, and positivity. They are competing for supremacy.’ “‘Which wolf wins?’ the grandson asks. ‘The one you feed,’ the elder replies.”","‘Every choice in life is a battle between two wolves inside us. One represents anger, envy, greed, fear, lies, insecurity, and ego. The other represents peace, love, compassion, kindness, humility, and positivity. They are competing for supremacy.’ “‘Which wolf wins?’ the grandson asks. ‘The one you feed,’ the elder replies.” “But how do we feed them?” I asked my teacher. The monk said, “By what we read and hear. By who we spend time with. By what we do with our time. By where we focus our energy and attention.”","The self, like the sun, is always there. We are not our minds.","The complication is that we are weighing input from different sources: our five senses, telling us what appeals in the moment; our memories, recalling what we have experienced in the past; and our intellects, synthesizing and evaluating the best choice for the long term.","“I can’t do this” becomes “I can do this by …”        “I’m bad at this” becomes “I’m investing the time I need to get better”        “I’m unlovable” becomes “I’m reaching out to new people to make new connections”        “I’m ugly” becomes “I’m taking steps to be my healthiest”        “I can’t handle everything” becomes “I’m prioritizing and checking items off my list”","“Make my mind my friend,”","“I know you’re worried and upset, and you feel like you can’t handle this, but you are strong. You can do it.” Remember, it’s about observing your feelings without judging them.","What is missing from this moment? What is unpleasant about today? What would I like to change?","“Detachment is not that you own nothing, but that nothing should own you.”","in. If immersion and extremes work best for you, you might commit to eliminating social media entirely for a week or a month. Or you might, as I mention above, go on the wagon for a month. If you work better in slow, gradual iterations, make a small change and build on it. In the case of technology, you could limit the amount of time you allow yourself to be online, or perhaps limit, but don’t fully eliminate, certain apps.","I’m great at some things and not so good at others. I’m well intentioned but imperfect.","The two things to remember are the bad we’ve done to others and the good others have done for us. By focusing on the bad we’ve done to others, our egos are forced to remember our imperfections and regrets. This keeps us grounded. When we remember the good others have done for us, we feel humbled by our need for others and our gratitude for the gifts we have received. The two things that we were told to forget are the good we’ve done for others and the bad others have done to us. If we fixate on and are impressed by our own good deeds, our egos grow, so we put those deeds aside. And if others treat us badly, we have to let that go too. This doesn’t mean we have to be best friends with someone hurtful, but harboring anger and grudges keeps us focused on ourselves instead of taking a broader perspective.","“What belongs to you today, belonged to someone yesterday and will be someone else’s tomorrow.”","Receiving an insult. Observe your ego, take a broader view of the person’s negativity, and respond to the situation, not the insult. Receiving a compliment or accolades. Take this opportunity to be grateful for the teacher who helped you further this quality. Arguing with a partner. The desire to be right, to win, comes from your ego’s unwillingness to admit weakness. Remember you can be right, or you can move forward. See the other person’s side. Lose the battle. Wait a day and see how it feels. Topping people. When we listen to others, we often one-up them with a story that shows how we have it better or worse. Instead, listen to understand and acknowledge. Be curious. Don’t say anything about yourself.","Humility comes from accepting where you are without seeing it as a reflection of who you are. Then you can use your imagination to find success.","When you fail, instead of giving in to a sense of victimhood, think of the moment as a humility anchor, keeping you grounded. Then ask yourself, “What is going to restore my confidence?” It won’t grow from an external factor that’s beyond your control. I couldn’t control whether someone gave me a job, but I focused on finding a way to be myself and do what I loved. I knew I could build confidence around that.","ego wants everyone to like you. High self-esteem is just fine if they don’t. The ego thinks it knows everything. Self-esteem thinks it can learn from anyone. The ego wants to prove itself. Self-esteem wants to express itself.","TRY THIS: WRITE DOWN THE AREAS IN WHICH YOU REALLY WANT TO BE CONFIDENT Health, career, relationship—pick one of these three. Write down what is going to make you feel confident in this area, something that’s realistic and achievable. Break your area down into small wins. Things you can achieve today.","Monks aren’t impressed by how long you meditate. We ask how deep you went. Bruce Lee said, “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”","Bring your awareness to your natural breathing pattern. Breathe in and out. Bring your awareness to your body. Become aware of where it touches the ground, a seat, and where it does not. You may find that your heels touch the ground but your arches don’t. Or your lower back touches the bed or mat but your middle back is slightly raised. Become aware of all these subtle connections. Now begin to scan your body. Bring your awareness to your feet. Scan your toes, your arches, your ankles, your heels. Become aware of the different sensations you may feel. You may feel relaxed, or you may feel pain, pressure, tingling, or something totally different. Become aware of it and then visualize that you are breathing in positive, uplifting, healing energy and breathing out any negative toxic energy. Now move upward to your legs, calves, shins, and knees. Again, just scan and observe the sensations. Whenever your mind wanders, gently and softly bring it back to your body. No force or pressure. No judgment. At some point you may come across pain you were not aware of before. Be present with that pain. Observe it. And again breathe into it three times and breathe out three times. You can also express gratitude for different parts of your body as you scan them. Do this all the way to the tip of your head. You can move as slowly or as quickly as you like, but don’t rush.","Visualize yourself in a place that makes you feel calm and relaxed. It might be a beach, a nature walk, a garden, or the top of a mountain. Feel the ground, sand, or water beneath your feet as you walk in this space. Without opening your eyes, look left. What do you notice? Observe it and keep walking. Look right. What do you notice? Observe it and keep walking Become aware of the colors, the textures, and the distances around you. What can you hear? The sounds of birds, water, or air? Feel the air and wind on your face. Find a calm, comfortable place to sit down. Breathe in the calm, balance, ease, stillness, and peace. Breathe out the stress, pressure, and negativity. Go to this place whenever you feel you need to relax.","I use an anti-anxiety technique called 5-4-3-2-1. We are going to find five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.","When the monkey mind, which amplifies negativity, tries to convince us that we’re useless and worthless, the more reasonable monk mind counters by pointing out that others have given us their time, energy, and love. They have made efforts on our behalf. Gratitude for their kindness is entwined with self-esteem, because if we are worthless, then that would make their generosity toward us worthless too.","AM GRATEFUL FOR … After sitting, relaxing, and doing breathwork, repeat “I am grateful for … ,” completing the phrase with as many things as you can.","If your boss gives you feedback that you don’t agree with, pause before reacting. Take a moment to think, What can I learn from this moment? Then look for gratitude: Maybe you can be grateful that your boss is trying to help you improve—or grateful that your boss has given you another reason to leave this job.","At least one will likely say, “Thanks for last night. It was awesome!” Another might say, “Thanks for last night—the food was wonderful, and I loved the funny, sweet toast you made to your friend.” It’s far better to express your gratitude in specific terms.","Close your eyes. Take yourself back to the place in time of one of these acts, and relive how it felt—the sights, scents, and sounds. Re-experience it with awe, and experience those feelings in a deeper way. After this visualization, recognize that small things are happening for you. Don’t overlook them or take them for granted. Next, take a moment to feel a sense of being cared for, thought of, loved. This should boost your selfesteem and self-confidence. Last, know that just feeling great is not the end goal. Let this reflection lead to you feeling like you want to reciprocate with love by giving back to those who have given to you, or by passing on the love and care to those who don’t have it.","TRY THIS: LEAD AND FOLLOW Make a list of your students and teachers. Now write down what the students could teach you and what the teachers might learn from you.","TRY THIS: REFLECT ON TRUST Pick three diverse people in your life—perhaps a colleague, a family member, and a friend—and decide which of the four Cs they bring to your life. Be grateful for that. Thank them for it.","TRY THIS: BE REALISTIC ABOUT YOUR FRIENDSHIPS Make a list of the people you have seen socially over the past week or two. In a second column, identify whether the person is a Season, a Reason, or a Lifetime friend. This, of course, is labeling, which I have urged you not to do. We have to allow for fluidity in the roles people play. But roughly sketching the landscape of your current social life can give you an idea as to whether you are surrounded by a balanced group of people—one that provides excitement, support, and long-term love. Now, in a third column, consider what role you play for each of these people. Are you offering what you receive? Where and how could you give more?","Physical attraction. You like what they look like—you are drawn to their appearance, style, or presence, or you like the idea of being seen with them. Material. You like their accomplishments and the power and/or the possessions this affords them. Intellectual. You like how they think—you’re stimulated by their conversation and ideas. Emotional. You connect well. They understand your feelings and increase your sense of well-being. Spiritual. They share your deepest goals and values.","We remember that we never know what someone is going through, so we treat them with the gentleness you would give someone who is in pain, with the generosity you would give someone who is hungry, with the compassion you would give someone who is misunderstood.","Like Satyarthi, we are motivated to serve when we think of the whole world as one family. You wouldn’t want your child to be enslaved or your parent to be homeless.","2. OM TAT SAT “The absolute truth is eternal.” This mantra appears in the Bhagavad Gita. It represents divine energy and invokes powerful blessings. All work is performed as an offering of love and service. This mantra is recited especially before beginning any important work, to help perfect and refine our intentions and bring about balance and wholeness.","3. LOKAH SAMASTAH SUKHINO BHAVANTU “May all beings everywhere be happy and free, and may the thoughts, words, and actions of my own life contribute in some way to that happiness and to that freedom for all.”","The externals will never be perfect, and the goal isn’t perfection. Life is not going to go your way. You have to go your way and take life with you. Understanding this will help you be prepared for whatever may come.","Throughout this book, we have encountered paradoxes. We talk about getting close to fear to move away from it, finding the new in our routines, having confidence and humility, being selfish to be selfless. We live in a binary world, but the beauty of paradox is that two opposing ideas can coexist. Life isn’t a computer program—it’s a dance.","Ask yourself, “What am I grateful for today?” Breathe in gratitude and breathe out negative, toxic energy. Now visualize a joy-, happiness-, and gratitude-filled memory. Think of five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Absorb the love, joy, and happiness. Take the love from that moment and visualize it flowing through your entire body. From your feet, to your legs, to your hips, to your stomach, to your chest, arms, back, neck, and head. Give love, joy, and gratitude to each part of your body. Do this for five minutes. Ask yourself, “What is my intention for today?” Is it to be kind, to be confident, to be focused? Set that intention now. Repeat the following to yourself 3 times each: “I am happy about who I am becoming. I am open to all opportunities and possibilities. I am worthy of real love. I am ready to serve with all I have.” To finish your practice, repeat this mantra 3 times: Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu.","Monks try to be present in the moment, but we are always conscious of now and forever. We measure our lives not by how big or small our impact is, but by how we make people feel. We use our time to establish how we will live on, through giving love and care, through supporting, communicating, creating—through the impact we have on humanity.","TRY THIS: TWO DEATH MEDITATIONS To imagine your own death gives you a bird’s-eye view of your life. Try a death meditation whenever you are questioning whether or not to do something—to make a significant change, learn a new skill, take a trip. I recommend that you always do a death meditation at the beginning of a new year, to inspire new paths in the upcoming year. Visualizing the inevitable will give you every lesson you need to live a fulfilling life. Fast-forward to yourself at age eighty or ninety, however long you want to live, and imagine yourself on your deathbed. Ask your future self questions such as:            What do I wish I’d done?            What experiences do I wish I’d had?            What do I regret not giving more attention?            What skills do I wish I’d worked on?            What do I wish I’d detached from? Use these answers to motivate yourself—instead of having regrets on your deathbed, put those wishes into action today. Imagine how you’d like to be remembered at your own funeral. Don’t focus on what people thought of you, who loved you, and how sad they will be to lose you. Instead think about the impact you’ve had. Then imagine how you would be remembered if you died today. What’s the gap between these two images? This too should galvanize you to build your legacy."]},{"title":"The Happiness Trap: Stop Struggling, Start Living","author":"Russ Harris","highlights":["In a state of defusion we: • Recognize that images are nothing more than pictures. • Recognize that those pictures cannot harm us in any way. • Pay attention to them only if they are helpful.","Fear • Anger • Shock • Disgust • Sadness • Guilt • Love • Joy • Curiosity You have just read a list of the nine basic human emotions.","If your family tended to suppress or hide their feelings, then you learned to keep your feelings bottled up. If your parents believed in “getting anger off your chest,” you may have learned that it’s good to express anger. But if you were frightened by a parent’s display of anger, you may have decided that anger is bad and should therefore be suppressed or avoided.","Which emotions were you told were desirable or undesirable? • What were you told about the best way to handle your emotions? • What emotions did your family freely express? • What emotions did your family suppress or frown on? • How did the adults in your family handle their own “negative” emotions? • What emotional control strategies did they use? • How did the adults in your family react to your “negative” emotions? • As a result of all this programming, what ideas are you still carrying around today about your emotions and how to handle them?","ACCEPTANCE IMAGERY This is a variation on the four-step expansion technique. It is often helpful for people who are good at visualizing. First scan your body and pick the sensation that bothers you the most. Observe it the way a curious scientist might. Now visualize that sensation as an object. What is the size and shape of it? Is it liquid, solid, or gaseous? Is it transparent or opaque? What color is it? Does the color vary? What is its temperature? Is it light, heavy, or weightless? How does the surface feel to the touch: rough, smooth, wet, dry, sticky, spiky, hot, cold? Is there any sound associated with it? Is there any vibration, pulsation, or movement within it? Is its position fixed or shifting? Take a few slow, deep breaths. Breathe into and around this object. Create space for it. Open up around it and allow it to be there, to stay right where it is. You don’t have to like it; just let it be. Don’t try to get rid of the object and don’t try to alter it. If it changes by itself, that’s okay. If it doesn’t change, that’s okay, too. The aim is simply to accept it.","So take a few minutes and write down answers to these questions (or at least spend a few minutes thinking about them): • What demons can you expect to find clambering up on deck as you steer your boat in a valued direction? • What feelings and sensations might possibly act as obstacles? • What thoughts and images might possibly act as obstacles?","Set yourself a few goals: specify the time, the place, and the activity you’ll do. Then engage yourself fully in that activity.","Notice at least five sounds you can hear, at least five objects you can see, and at least five things you can feel against the surface of your body (such as the air on your face or your shoes around your feet).","Inwardly scan your body from head to toe; notice the sensations in your head, chest, arms, abdomen, legs.","Notice the rise and fall of your rib cage and the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Follow the air in through your nose. Notice how your lungs expand. Feel your abdomen push outward.

Well, I was just about to cook something healthy for dinner. Is this something I value? Yes, it is. So let’s focus on chopping up these potatoes.”","Q: Why not? A: Because continually trying to maintain that high self-esteem can actually pull you away from what you value. Remember Michelle, working late at the office to improve her sense of worthiness, but missing out on spending time with her family? High self-esteem may give you some pleasant feelings in the short term, but in the long run, trying to maintain it will probably exhaust you. Because of the way the human mind has evolved, the “not good enough” story will always return in one form or another. Do you want to spend the rest of your life battling it? Why bother when you can have a fulfilling life without exerting all that effort?","It easily leads to arrogance, righteousness, selfishness, egotism, or a false sense of superiority (which then readily feeds into discrimination and prejudice).","One group that particularly suffers is those for whom high self-esteem is largely dependent upon excelling at work. When they perform well, they feel great, but as soon as their performance drops (as it always will, sooner or later), their self-esteem comes crashing down. This leads them into a vicious cycle, putting increasing pressure on themselves to perform ever better, which leads to high stress, fatigue, and burnout. However, the good news is, leading a rich, full, and meaningful life doesn’t depend on self-esteem in the slightest.","Don’t try to prove yourself. Don’t try to think of yourself as a “good person.” Don’t try to justify your self-worth. Whatever judgments your thinking self makes of you — whether positive or negative — see them for what they are (just words) and let them go.","Deep down inside, what is important to you? • What do you want your life to be about? • What sort of person do you want to be? • What sort of relationships do you want to build? • If you weren’t struggling with your feelings or avoiding your fears, what would you channel your time and energy into doing?","I spent too much time worrying about . . . • I spent too little time doing things such as . . . • If I could go back in time, then what I would do differently from today onward is . . .","If a miracle could happen so that you automatically had the full approval of everyone who matters to you (and therefore you weren’t trying to please or impress anyone), then what sort of things would you do with your life and what sort of person would you try to be? 2.

Now, which would you prefer to spend time with, the actual living person or a documentary about that person? So, there’s this huge difference between who we are and any documentary that anyone could ever make about us, no matter how “truthful” that documentary may be.","The observing self can’t be judged as good or bad, right or wrong, because all it does is observe. If you do “the wrong thing” or a “bad thing,” the observing self is not in any way responsible; it merely notices what you’ve done and helps make you aware of it (thereby enabling you to learn from it). Moreover, the observing self will never judge you because judgments are thoughts and the observing self cannot think. It notices thoughts, but it cannot generate them. The observing self sees things as they are, without judging, criticizing, or doing any of the other thinking processes that set us up for a struggle with reality. Therefore, it gives acceptance in its truest, purest form."]},{"title":"Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon","author":"Colin;Carr Bryar","highlights":["Customer Obsession. Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers. 2. Ownership. Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say, “that’s not my job.” 3. Invent and Simplify. Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time. 4. Are Right, A Lot. Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs. 5. Learn and Be Curious. Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them. 6. Hire and Develop the Best. Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice. 7. Insist on the Highest Standards. Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed. 8. Think Big. Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers. 9. Bias for Action. Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking. 10. Frugality. Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense. 11. Earn Trust. Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best. 12. Dive Deep. Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them. 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit. Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly. 14. Deliver Results. Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.","Three foundational mechanisms are: the annual planning process; the S-Team goals process (the S-Team consists of the senior vice presidents and direct reports to Jeff Bezos); and Amazon’s compensation plan, which aligns incentives with what’s best for customers and the company over the long term.","Assessment of past performance, including goals achieved, goals missed, and lessons learned Key initiatives for the following year A detailed income statement Requests (and justifications) for resources, which may include things like new hires, marketing spend, equipment, and other fixed assets","Three notably Amazonian features of S-Team goals are their unusually large number, their level of detail, and their aggressiveness. S-Team goals once numbered in the dozens, but these have expanded to many hundreds every year, scattered across the entire company.","S-Team goals are aggressive enough that Amazon only expects about three-quarters of them to be fully achieved during the year. Hitting every one of them would be a clear sign that the bar had been set too low.","“Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.”","The wrong kind of compensation practice can cause misalignment in two ways: (1) by rewarding short-term goals at the expense of long-term value creation, and (2) by rewarding the achievement of localized departmental milestones whether or not they benefit the company as a whole. Both can powerfully drive behaviors that are antithetical to the company’s ultimate goals.","Many companies set entirely independent goals for key players at every level. All too often this gives rise to infighting, information withholding, and hoarding of resources, as each leader is incentivized to undermine the other. Amazon’s compensation is, by contrast, simple and oriented toward the long term. As one is promoted at Amazon, the ratio of cash to equity compensation becomes more and more skewed toward long-term equity.","An Amazon quarterly business review, for instance, might be broken down like this instead: Introduction Tenets Accomplishments Misses Proposals for Next Period Headcount P&L FAQ Appendices (includes things like supporting data in the form of spreadsheets, tables and charts, mock-ups)","Working as Jeff’s shadow was a bit like drinking from a fire hose. One surprising challenge of the job I (Colin) noticed early on was just how much context switching went on each day. Every week Jeff—and therefore I—had three recurring meetings: the four-hour S-Team meeting discussed in the previous chapter, a Weekly Business Review (chapter six), and an informal Monday-morning S-Team breakfast near the office. In addition to those, on any given day we’d usually meet with two to four product teams, where we’d spend between one and two hours doing a deep dive on new products and features. Throw in the occasional retail, finance, and operations updates, plus a fire drill or two requiring immediate attention, and you have a typical week.","Suppose Sony decides to introduce a new TV. The sales and marketing group has done its research into customer preferences and market trends (but not necessarily the customer experience) and has determined that Sony should offer a 44-inch TV at a price point of $1,999. The engineering team, however, has been working on the new TV for quite some time, and their focus has been on picture quality, which means higher resolution, and they have not been especially concerned about price point. The TV they come up with will cost $2,000 just to manufacture. So there is no way that the retail price can be $1,999. If the two organizations had started the process by writing a press release, they would have had to agree on the features, cost, customer experience, and price. Then they could have worked backwards to figure out what to build, thereby surfacing the challenges they would face in product development and manufacturing.","A common question asked by executives when reviewing the product features in the PR is “so what?” If the press release doesn’t describe a product that is meaningfully better (faster, easier, cheaper) than what is already out there, or results in some stepwise change in customer experience, then it isn’t worth building.","The CEO, and companies in general, have very little ability to directly control output metrics. What’s really important is to focus on the “controllable input metrics,” the activities you directly control, which ultimately affect output metrics such as share price.","When the retail, operations, and finance teams began to construct the initial Amazon WBR, they turned to a well-known Six Sigma process improvement method called DMAIC, an acronym for Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control.1 Should you decide to implement a Weekly Business Review for your business, we recommend following the DMAIC steps as well. The order of the steps matters. Progressing through this metrics life cycle in this order can prevent a lot of frustration and rework, allowing you to achieve your goals faster.","continual improvement is the operating philosophy.2 Amazon takes this philosophy to heart, focusing most of its effort on leading indicators (we call these “controllable input metrics”) rather than lagging indicators (“output metrics”). Input metrics track things like selection, price, or convenience—factors that Amazon can control through actions such as adding items to the catalog, lowering cost so prices can be lowered, or positioning inventory to facilitate faster delivery to customers. Output metrics—things like orders, revenue, and profit—are important, but they generally can’t be directly manipulated in a sustainable manner over the long term. Input metrics measure things that, done right, bring about the desired results in your output metrics.","Since it’s a cycle, you can start at any input. The metrics for Customer Experience, for example, could include speed of shipping, breadth of selection, richness of product information, ease of use, and so forth. Watch what happens when we improve customer experience: Better customer experience leads to more traffic. More traffic attracts more sellers seeking those buyers. More sellers lead to wider selection. Wider selection enhances customer experience, completing the circle. The cycle drives growth, which in turn lowers cost structure. Lower costs lead to lower prices, improving customer experience, and the flywheel","The Amazon flywheel captures the major aspect of what makes Amazon’s retail business successful. Therefore, it should be no surprise that almost all the metrics discussed in the WBR can be categorized into one of the flywheel elements. In fact, the first page of the WBR deck has a picture of the very same flywheel above.","One of the metrics we initially chose for selection was the number of new detail pages created, on the assumption that more pages meant better selection. Once we identified this metric, it had an immediate effect on the actions of the retail teams. They became excessively focused on adding new detail pages—each team added tens, hundreds, even thousands of items to their categories that had not previously been available on Amazon.","We soon saw that an increase in the number of detail pages, while seeming to improve selection, did not produce a rise in sales, the output metric.","Removing bias is just as important in metrics. Each of Jeff’s direct reports who ran a business unit had an inherent bias to choose metrics and collect data that would show that their units were trending positive. It’s just human nature to want to succeed.","Having an independent person or team involved with measurement can help you seek out and eliminate biases in your data.","Often the data you want will be scattered across different systems and may take some serious software resources to compile, aggregate, and display correctly. Do not compromise here. Make the investment. If you don’t, you may find that you are flying blind with respect to some important aspect of the business.","We take a snapshot of our catalog each night at 11 p.m., determine which items are in stock, and weight each item by trailing 30-day product sales. That is, if product A has sold 30 units in the past month and product B has sold 10 units in the past month, and they are both out of stock at the time the in-stock measurement is recorded, product A will impact the in-stock metric three times more than product B will. We add software to the product pages that performs the following actions. Every time a product page is displayed, we add one to the metric “Total Number of Product Pages Displayed.” If that product is in stock when it is displayed, we add one to the metric “Total Number of In-Stock Product Pages Displayed.” At the end of the day, we divide the “Total Number of In-Stock Product Pages Displayed” by the “Total Number of Product Pages Displayed,” to get our overall in-stock metric for the day. For example, suppose you displayed one million detail pages total across every product in your catalog, and 850,000 of those product pages displayed a product that was in stock. Then your demand-weighted instock percentage for that day would be 85 percent. Products that customers view more have a greater impact on this metric than products that are viewed rarely. Each of these metrics measures in-stock in a different way and can yield quite a different result for the same business on the same day. The first metric may skew the data depending on the time of day the company receives the bulk of its inventory. If most of the inventory comes in at night, the item could have been out of stock for most of the day but replenished just before the in-stock data is collected. The result will be that the in-stock performance will look better to the company than what the bulk of the customers actually experienced that day. And if a popular item is out of stock for a long period of time, it will have less of an impact on the metric each day since the metric is weighted by trailing 30-day sales of that item. The second metric, while more expensive to collect (at least in the short run), is a more accurate representation of what customers experienced that day. It captures, from a customer point of view, what percent of the time they experienced that Amazon was in-stock on the item(s) they viewed. The first metric is inward-facing and operations-centric, while the second metric is out-ward-facing and customer-centric. Start with the customer and work backwards by aligning your metrics with the customer experience.","COVID-19 by region. It is not enough to look at the number of positive tests in your region as compared to another region with a population of a similar size. You must also look at the number of tests per capita performed in each region. Since both the number of positive tests and the number of tests per capita in each location will keep changing, you will need to keep updating your audit of the measurements.*","“Five Whys” method developed at Toyota and used by many companies worldwide. When you see an anomaly, ask why it happened and iterate with another “Why?” until you get to the underlying factor that was the real culprit.","The deck presents a consistent, end-to-end review of the business each week that is designed to follow the customer experience with Amazon.","In the WBR, Amazon analyzes trend lines to highlight challenges as they emerge rather than waiting for them to be summed up in quarterly or yearly results.","Care is taken to ensure that prior periods are structured to provide apples-to-apples comparisons so as not to highlight false variances due to predictable things","anecdotes and exception reporting—that is, the description of an element that falls outside some standard or usual situation. Both tools enable you to dive into examples that contain something that doesn’t follow the natural or accustomed patterns and that can sometimes, but not always, reveal a defect, a broken process, or a problem with system logic.","We use consistent and familiar formatting to speed interpretation A good deck uses a consistent format throughout—the graph design, time periods covered, color palette, symbol set (for current year/prior year/goal), and the same number of charts on every page wherever possible. Some data naturally lend themselves to different presentations, but the default is to display in the standard format. Amazon thereby looks at the same set of data every week, in the same order, and gets a holistic view of the business. The team builds up expertise in spotting trends and picks up the rhythm of the review; anomalies stand out more distinctly, and the meeting runs more efficiently.","If things are operating normally, say “Nothing to see here” and move along. The goal of the meeting is to discuss exceptions and what is being done about them. The status quo needs no elaboration.","at Amazon we routinely place our trailing 6 weeks and trailing 12 months side by side on the same x-axis. The effect is like adding a “zoom” function to a static graph that gives you a snapshot of a shorter time period, with the added bonus that you’re seeing both the monthly graph and the “zoomed-in” version of it simultaneously.","With a sizable existing business, if you only pay attention to the output metric “revenue,” you typically won’t see the effects of new customer deceleration for quite some time. However, if you look at input metrics instead—things like “new customers,” “new customer revenue,” and “existing customer revenue”—you will detect the signal much earlier, and with a much clearer call to action.","Amazon employs many techniques to ensure that anecdotes reach the teams that own and operate a service. One example is a program called the Voice of the Customer. The customer service department routinely collects and summarizes customer feedback and presents it during the WBR, though not necessarily every week. The chosen feedback does not always reflect the most commonly received complaint, and the CS department has wide latitude on what to present. When the stories are read at the WBR, they are often painful to hear because they highlight just how much we let customers down.","Exception reports come in many flavors, but the following Contribution Profit (CP) example should illustrate the basic concept and its usefulness. CP is defined as the incremental money generated after selling an item and deducting the variable costs associated with that item. It’s essentially the money the company has left over after the sale of the item, which goes to pay for the fixed costs of the business and, ideally after that, contributes a profit. There is a CP Exception report that lists the top ten CP negative products (ones that did not generate a profit) within a category for the previous week.","As we considered the problem of the damaged lawn furniture before the next call arrived, Jeff blurted out, “We need an Andon Cord for customer service.” There was no assembly line to halt, but the CS agent would be given the authority to click on what we called “the big red button” on their control screen. Once that button was clicked, two things happened: the “Add to Cart” and “1-Click” buttons would disappear from the product page so no customers could buy that product, and the category manager would immediately be notified that purchasing for one of their products had been disabled until they could investigate and fix the issue.","Controllable input metrics are a quantitative (diving deep with data) and qualitative (anecdotes) way of measuring how well the organization is satisfying these customer interests so that the output metrics trend the way the company desires."]},{"title":"Leadershift (The 11 Essential Changes Every Leader Must Embrace)","author":"John C.

There are always other solutions. If we believe they are there and we’re willing to look for them, we will find them. MENTAL BLOCK #2: “THAT’S NOT LOGICAL” Albert Einstein said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.”2 Imagination turns possibilities into reality. It’s willing to take leaps that logic can’t. While logic does have great value and you should keep it, you should intentionally add creativity. MENTAL BLOCK #3: “FOLLOW THE RULES” I’ve always loved this quote from Thomas Edison: “There ain’t no rules around here! We are tryin’ to accomplish some[thing]!”3 Most revolutionary ideas have been disruptive violations of set rules. MENTAL BLOCK #4: “AVOID AMBIGUITY” Life is complex. It’s messy. It’s contradictory and paradoxical. Why in the world would we think we should—or could—avoid ambiguity? There is never one fixed way to understand something—everything can be understood in more than one way. MENTAL BLOCK #5: “FAILURE IS BAD” Creative people don’t avoid failure. They see it as a friend. They know that if they are to experiment, innovate, and create, they will fail. They embrace risk. MENTAL BLOCK #6: “DON’T BE FOOLISH” To stand up is to stand out. You have to stick your neck out to put your head above the crowd. If others don’t at first understand or accept you, so what? All the great dreamers looked foolish to someone. How you are perceived by others is less important than how effective you can be. MENTAL BLOCK #7: “I’M NOT CREATIVE” The mental block that most keeps us from being creative is believing we don’t possess creativity. This self-perception is a barrier to talent, opportunity, and intelligence. But the truth is that everyone can learn to be creative. The only real block to creativity is our disbelief. I love what blogger Hugh MacLeod said about this: “Everyone is born creative; everyone is given a box of crayons in kindergarten. Then when you hit puberty they take the crayons away and replace them with dry, uninspiring books on algebra, history, etc. Being suddenly hit years later with the ‘creative bug’ is just a wee voice telling you, ‘I’d like my crayons back, please.’”4","This last 10 percent is like putting the cherry on top.

Yet, a traditional bureaucratic structure, with its need for predictability, linear logic, conformance to accepted norms, and the dictates of the most recent “long-range” vision statement, is a nearly perfect idea-killing machine.

One example he gives is what he calls the John McCain effect, which he says is “the capacity to convince others of how the world should be.1","One of the dangers when anyone begins discussing moral authority is that it can sound mystical and out of reach. However, it is grounded in four things: competence, courage, consistency, and character.","Level 1: Position—People Follow Because They Have To The authority someone receives at this level is very limited and is restricted to the leader’s job description. A leader need not be competent to receive a leadership appointment. In some organizations, that person doesn’t even have to be competent to retain a leadership position. Level 2: Permission—People Follow Because They Want To A leader begins to develop authority at this second level. When the leader builds relationships, people are willing to work with them because they like them and enjoy spending time with them. They are beginning to give permission for the person to lead them. Level 3: Production—People Follow Because You Demonstrate Competence On this third level a leader begins to demonstrate genuine competence. Being productive is a big step in gaining moral authority with others. People follow because the leader has produced results and is successful, and they want to be on a winning team. Level 4: People Development—People Follow Because You Help Them Become Competent When you start to invest in people and help them to become successful personally, your level of authority rises dramatically, the lives of the people you help improve, and this gives you a level of credibility you can gain no other way. Level 5: Pinnacle—People Follow Because You Have a Reputation for Excellence When you live a life of competence, influence people at each of the first four levels, and develop leaders over a long period of time, you can approach the pinnacle of leadership. This is where true moral authority is established.","Courage Encourages People During Difficult and Uncertain Times","Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow.’”","Author and artist Mary Anne Radmacher said, “Courage doesn’t always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow.’”","1. COMPETENCE—THE ABILITY TO LEAD WELL","2. COURAGE—MOVING FORWARD IN THE FACE OF FEAR","Every leader who possesses moral authority has had to stand alone at some point in time. Such moments make leaders. Such stands are often very difficult, but when leaders look back afterward, they often see those as their proudest moments.","“Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.”","We all know plenty of people who have those qualities but who exercise no influence over us whatsoever. Why? Because there is a contradiction between what they claim to be and what we perceive them to be.11 What Stanley described is internal consistency between values and actions, which is essential to a leader’s success if he or she desires to gain moral authority. Equally important is the ability to be consistent over time.","CONSISTENCY ESTABLISHES YOUR REPUTATION. Nearly anyone can be good once. Being good continually is difficult. However, continued repetition leads to a positive reputation.         •     CONSISTENCY MAKES TEAM MEMBERS MORE SECURE. Perhaps the greatest compliment a person can receive is, “I can depend on you.” A consistent leader inspires team members to become more confident.         •     CONSISTENCY ALLOWS FOR ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF YOUR GROWTH. It’s difficult to gauge the progress of inconsistent people. The track record we establish shows what we have done and how far we have come.         •     CONSISTENCY MAKES YOU RELEVANT. People who bounce back and forth between engagement and disengagement always have to play catch-up. By staying consistently engaged, you don’t fall behind.         •     CONSISTENCY MODELS YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR OTHERS. When you consistently model your values and work ethic, team members know what you expect of them because they’ve seen it every day. Consistency always reinforces expectations.         •     CONSISTENCY MAINTAINS YOUR MESSAGE. When a leader communicates a vision but acts in ways that are inconsistent with that vision the result is confusion. It distracts from the message and makes it more difficult for everyone on the team.","CHARACTER—BEING BIGGER ON THE INSIDE THAN THE OUTSIDE","LEADERS OF INTEGRITY DO THE RIGHT THING, EVEN WHEN IT’S HARD, EVEN WHEN IT’S NOT BEST FOR THEM PERSONALLY.","Leaders of integrity do the right thing, even when it’s hard, even when it’s not best for them personally.

When you think you have determined the issues, take a hard look at them. Is each one a separate and distinct issue? If so, then your issue list is mutually exclusive. Does every aspect of the problem come under one (and only one) of these issues—that is, have you thought of everything? If so, then your issues are collectively exhaustive.","Overlap represents muddled thinking by the writer and leads to confusion for the reader.","If you are the team leader, you should try to be the thought leader too.

Now I can solve problem X, if that’s what you really want, but I think it’s in our interest to focus on Y.” If you have the data to back you up, the client can either accept your recommendation or tell you to stay on the original problem, but you will have fulfilled your responsibility to act in the client’s best interests.","We made frequent use of an analytical framework called Forces at Work. It proved especially valuable at the start of an engagement in helping us look at the likely external pressures on the client. The technique involves identifying the client’s suppliers, customers, competitors, and possible substitute products. We then list all the changes occurring in each of the four categories. What impact—positive or negative—could these have on our client? Also, what internal changes are affecting the client and the client’s industry? Which of these factors could actually cause major changes to the way the client designs, manufactures, distributes, sells, and services its products?","When generating an initial hypothesis, you don’t need all the facts, just enough to have a good overview of the industry and the problem. If the problem is in your own business, you may already have the facts in your head. That’s great, but facts are not enough. You have to apply structure to them. To structure your IH begin by breaking the problem into its components—the key drivers (see “Find the Key Drivers,” in Chapter 3). Next, make an actionable recommendation regarding each driver.","For your next step, you must take each top-line recommendation and break it down to the level of issues. If a given recommendation is correct, what issues does it raise? Consider the likely answers to each issue. Then go down another level. For each issue, what analyses would you need to make to prove or disprove your hypothesis? With a little experience, and a lot of debate within your team, you should get a good sense of what is provable and what is not.

So politics is just people acting in their own interests.","It doesn’t always work (sometimes the bread falls butter-side up), but if you keep your eyes peeled for examples of 80/20 in your business, you will come up with ways to improve it.","McKinsey gathers enough facts to prove or disprove a hypothesis or support or refute an analysis—and only enough facts. This is the flip side of fact-based analysis in a business situation. Anything more is a waste of time and effort when both are precious commodities.","In any McKinsey team meeting where problem solving is on the agenda, someone will use the inelegant phrase “key drivers,” as in, “Vik, I think these are the key drivers of this issue.” In other words, there may be a 100 different factors affecting the sales of our widgets—weather, consumer confidence, raw material prices—but the three most important ones are X, Y, and Z.

First, and obviously, what are the questions to which you need answers? Write them all down in any order. Second, and more important, what do you really need from this interview? What are you trying to achieve? Why are you talking to this person?

Is she a prickly CEO who might bite your head off if you ask a sensitive question?","start with general questions and move on to specific ones. Don’t dive right into a sensitive area like “What are your responsibilities?” or “How long have you been with the company?” Start with anodyne questions about, say, the industry overall.","When deciding on which questions to ask, you might want to include some to which you know the answer. This may sound counterintuitive, but it’s really very useful. On questions of fact, asking a “ringer” will give you some insights into the interviewee’s honesty and/or knowledge. For complex issues, you may think you “know” the answer, but there may be more than one; you should find out as many as possible. Once you’ve written your guide, look at it and ask yourself, “What are the three things I most want to know by the end of the interview?” These are the things you will focus on when you go into the interviewee’s office, the three things that you will try your hardest to obtain before you leave. Sometimes you won’t even get those answers (see “Difficult Interviews” later in the chapter), and sometimes they’ll come easily. Anything more is gravy. Finally,","If you repeat their own words back to them—ideally with some structure applied—then they can tell you whether you understood them correctly. Paraphrasing also gives the interviewee a chance to add information or amplify important points.","“Excuse me, ma’am, but there’s something I forgot to ask.” This question invariably gave Columbo the answer he needed to figure out who did it. If there’s a particular question you need the answer to, or a piece of data that you want, the Columbo tactic is often a good way to get it.","ALWAYS WRITE A THANK-YOU NOTE When you get back to your office after interviewing someone, take the time to write a thank-you letter. It’s polite and professional, and could pay you back in unexpected ways.","Again, brainstorming is about generating new ideas. If all the team members come into the room saying the same old things and agreeing with one another, then you’ve gained nothing and wasted time.","McKinsey uses an excellent device to preserve the outcomes of brainstorming sessions. Although practically every meeting room has a white board and markers that wipe clean with an eraser or paper towel, some have white boards that can make paper copies of whatever is written on them.","The Post-it™ exercise. Give everyone in the room a pad of sticky notes. The participants then write out any relevant ideas they have, one idea per note, and hand them over to the leader, who reads them aloud.

And between her and herself.","And then he had told her about a man called Robin Dunbar at Oxford University, who had discovered that human beings were wired to know only a hundred and fifty people, as that was the average size of hunter-gatherer communities. ‘And the Domesday Book,’ Ash had told her, under the stark lighting of the hospital canteen, ‘if you look at the Domesday Book, the average size of an English community at that time was a hundred and fifty people.

You just have to live it.’","It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from. That the prison wasn’t the place, but the perspective. And the most peculiar discovery Nora made was that, of all the extremely divergent variations of herself she had experienced, the most radical sense of change happened within the exact same life.","She had felt other things before and she would feel other things again. Sometimes simultaneously. Yes, there may be a bass drum of despair, but there were other instruments at her disposal too.

I cannot emphasize this enough. Your inbox is not your to-do list. It is nothing more than a holding pen for where new inputs land.","Turn off every sound and graphic. That way, you can revisit the inbox when you’re ready to, not when the inbox is nagging you to return.","Every time you open your inbox, your mindset is not to check what’s new, but to make the decisions and create the momentum needed to move those emails to where they need to get to.","Delete it, or file it away Do it now (if less than a two-minute action, automatically do it then and there) Do it later Decide it doesn’t need an action, but file it for reference or future use Delegate it for someone else to do Defer the decision about whether the action needs doing to a later stage (usually by adding to your calendar) Decide there is no action from you, but that you want to track whether someone else follows through.","For every 800 emails you have, there will be around 20 there that will matter and 780 that can either be deleted, filed or at worst, very quickly replied to in just a few seconds.","I hate to demean your sense of status and importance, but those emails probably aren’t going to bring down your company, nor are they going to bring about world peace.","What goes in the @Action folder? Any email that you’ve received where you know a reply or other email action is needed and where the action will take longer than two minutes. What doesn’t belong in the @Action folder? Any emails where the response is a non-email related action (for example, where the email you’ve received prompts your decision to call someone, look into something, bring up something at a meeting, or generally deal with it in a way where the reminder is better stored on some kind of to-do list rather than in your inbox). We’ll talk about the idea of keeping such items on a Master Actions List, part of your new ‘second brain’, in the next few chapters! Any emails that can be replied to or dealt with in less than two minutes – just do those straight away, rather than clogging up your action folder with them! Any emails where you ‘think there’s probably something to do’ but haven’t decided what the action is – don’t be lazy in your thinking. Put it back in the inbox and work out the next step before you continue!","What goes in the @Read folder? Anything that you want to scan your eyeballs over at a later stage rather than read as soon as it lands in your inbox. What doesn’t belong in the @Read folder? Anything where you know there’s an action to perform. Make the distinction that the @Action folder is where you keep anything that needs an action, no matter how long those emails are! Anything that can be read and then either deleted or filed in less than two minutes (just do those as you go!). Any emails you don’t know whether you need to read or not – don’t move things there until you have made a definite decision of commitment. And be ruthless. Time spent reading someone else’s report is time not spent on creating impact and value. So be careful where you plan to put your attention. The @Read folder gives you the opportunity to save up big piles of reading for quieter periods and periods of inactive attention. Returning once a week to the @Read folder will have you speed reading ruthlessly through things that could easily have proved major distractions when you really needed to focus on other things. So using the @Read folder as a reminder to stay ruthless and focused is a huge Ninja advantage.","What goes in the @Waiting folder? Any emails where you’re waiting on someone else to do something and where you are committed to seeing a successful conclusion (if you don’t care, why track it anyway?). Emails you have sent that you would like to track in this same way. What doesn’t belong in the @Waiting folder? Anything where you’re not clear on who or what you’re waiting on (these need to be thought through properly before you move them in here – @Waiting is not a catch-all for the stuff you don’t want to think about right now!","You have 30 seconds to establish whether the email is important to you at all. You don’t have to complete the reading or reply in that 30 seconds, but in that 30 seconds you do need to change your ‘maybe’ to a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. So at the end of the 30-second eyeball, you’ve either scanned and deleted it, moved it somewhere for further reading or decided that an action is needed.","Complete zero – where both your inbox and @Action folder are at zero, and where you have also paid some attention to your @Read and @Waiting folders – is something I try to get to once a week. It doesn’t always happen and it’s not worth becoming obsessed about (some things do naturally run on longer than the arbitrary point in the week you designate for a complete zero assault – and this is fine), but even when it doesn’t quite happen I can get close to it. It takes the feeling of completion to an even greater and more profound level.","enough … Leads to … Capture and Collect … feeling overwhelmed as new information inputs arrive and are not dealt with, feeling uncertain about what we should be doing and feeling stressed that we might be missing things. Organize … a lack of clarity about how long things might take, which tasks are the highest priority and an unrealistic impression of what’s really on our plate. Review … feeling unsure that we’re on top of our work, an inability to put things in perspective, a level of constant stress that leads us to inefficiency, a constant sense of panic and a reactive rather than proactive style of working. Do … work piling up not done! There are times when we’re resisting the actual doing in favour of more organizing or tinkering.

The second brain is made up of the following basic elements, all of which we’ll be returning to in the coming chapters: Memory A list of the tasks you’re working on A ‘bigger picture’ list of the wider projects these tasks relate to Other lists and reference information – basically, things that could be useful in the future. Intelligence A series of questions to help support good decision-making and force the clarity that reduces your stress Checklists and a routine to support regular review – both daily and weekly – of everything held in the second brain.

It requires a bit of organization though. Try setting up a folder called ‘Desktop Inbox’ and regularly sweep all of those random documents inside it. Once you have a good pile in there, you can spend a few minutes filing them all back into the right place, or of course getting delete-happy with what you don’t need!","When thinking about where your collection points are, it’s worth remembering that your job is not just to collect, but also to empty! Try to design your system in such a way as to encourage the least resistance to using it:","For this exercise, write a list of all of the collection points in your own system. These might be tools you use already, new things you’re going to put in place, or new ways to use old tools. The important thing to know is that you’ve answered this question: ‘How will I know that I’ve captured and collected everything where there might be a potential action that’s worth doing?’","Tear a small strip of paper and write something on it that’s on your mind because it’s not currently getting done. Once written, add the piece of paper to your in-tray. At this point, this could be something nagging you, a task at the back of your mind, or even just a vague idea that there’s some action needed on a certain project or issue.","Think about the different roles you play in life (parent, partner, child, employee, manager, coach, household head chef, household head finance manager, landlord, volunteer, etc.). Most of us play many different roles in life and perhaps you’ve focused more of your attention to some and less to others.","want to emphasize that it’s not unusual for people to feel stressed at the end of this exercise. The mind has a powerful hold over our ability to take action so if you do feel stressed, move swiftly on to the Organize section now, where we’ll put that right.","THE PROJECTS LIST Let’s look first at the highest of the three levels. We’re going to use a single ‘Projects List’ to keep track of all the projects we’re working on. I would define a project as a collection of actions that is designed to achieve a particular aim. Therefore, a project is any piece of work that requires more than a couple of action steps to complete, regardless of how big or small.","NAMING A PROJECT When thinking about defining and naming your projects, it’s important to help your mind visualize a successful final outcome. So think about the following questions: What is the successful outcome I’m seeking? How will I measure success?","Personally, I have a number of different categories of projects that relate to the different ‘departments’ within Think Productive (Clients, Backstage, Workshops and so on) as well as categories for personal projects, charity projects and so on.","listed with a letter and a number to ensure they’re kept together on my Projects List (so the ‘B’ here just stands for ‘book’!) and that they’re also in the most logical order: B1 – writing B2 – editing B3 – proofing B4 – graphic design","It’s a Master Actions List. As such, it contains every single action you could currently do, for each and every project","The language of the Master Actions List is deliberately designed to encourage action rather than the need for more thinking. Each action should describe exactly what you need to do next.","Print out draft of report and write down final changes to make Finish report Report deadline today!!

I have the same for other people I line manage directly.","anything that you decide needs to be done and that you decide can probably be completed or moved forward in less than two minutes should be done straight away instead of a reminder being added to your Master Actions List.","They do indeed provide focus, but they can also quickly fall prey to what psychologists label ‘the planning fallacy’. At the start of the day, when you’re feeling fresh, it’s all too easy to be overambitious and fill your Daily To-Do List with far too many things, underestimating not just how long each item would take, but the ebbs and flows in our level of attention and, critically, the potential new inputs that may show up and need managing during the day.","So perhaps at lunch time, or at choice moments throughout the day, it’s worth renegotiating what’s achievable. Productivity is so determined by momentum that you can ill afford to let your own lists become a source of stress! So change the rules and win.","Never, ever forget that you are not a superhero. You are a Ninja. You’re human. You must realize that the world changes, but that you’re as prepared as you can be, that you’re making intelligent decisions, you’re on top of new inputs and their potential impact, you’re working on the most appropriate stuff and you’re getting into the Ninja work groove whenever you possibly can … And you know what? That’s all you can ever do.","So the ‘Waiting For’ List is a cunning, stealth-like little tool that helps a Ninja get around the problem of other people and their unproductive mess. The idea is pretty simple: just keep a list tracking all of the people who are off doing things that you want to make sure actually get done. This allows you to track these items during the Review phase and chase as appropriate. The @Waiting folder in your email inbox, as featured in our earlier chapter on email, is simply the email equivalent of this. I use my Waiting For List to keep track of a whole myriad of items such as … Sales enquiries (‘John said he’d get back to me by the second week of January.’) Outstanding payments (‘Waiting on expense claim from client X.’) Personal reminders (‘Waiting on tickets for Wimbledon – being mailed in early May.’)","With your three levels of lists, the Projects List, Master Actions List and a Daily To-Do List, you’re well on your way to having everything you need.","One thing that grew out of my Good Ideas Park was a separate list which I call ‘Watch/Read/Hear’.

GET MY SECOND BRAIN UP TO DATE Calendar/Diary: Go through each appointment in my calendar for the last two weeks – are there any follow-ups I need to do? Go through the next three weeks of my calendar – any new actions here? If I have a paper-based calendar, make sure it has all the same appointments in it as my Outlook calendar! If there’s also a wall planner for the team in the office, do the same with this. Think further ahead in the diary and look for initial conversations, or where I need to make advanced travel plans like booking flights, booking rail tickets in advance and so on. Master Actions List: Check for completed items and cross them off. Read and ensure I have clarity about each action listed. Waiting For List: Are there any items on here that I’m no longer waiting for and can remove? Do the quick one- to two-minute emails to chase up any items that are now becoming urgent. Add anything that is going to take longer to chase to my Master Actions List. Projects List: Any projects that are finished or simply no longer need to happen? Any new projects to add? Do I have any additional projects kept somewhere else (such as a team project plan)? If so, add these to my Projects List so that I have everything in one place.","STAGE 3. THINK AHEAD Projects List: Go through each project in turn and make sure I have added new next physical actions to my Master Actions List. At the very least, ensure that I have one action on my Master Actions List that relates to each project. Think about the strategic level with each of these projects. What more is needed? Master Actions List: Decide on the main activity areas for the next week. Think about what my big priorities will be. What items need to be crossed out for next week to be judged a success? Make a reminder note in my calendar or mark the high-priority tasks. Which items will present a big challenge to my proactive attention? Schedule these in the diary specifically.

People: Are there any conversations I need to have with people to ensure that they are prepared for the things happening next week? Drop quick emails to people confirming meetings or ask for more information in preparation for next week. Is there anyone (boss, assistant, colleague) who needs to know more about my schedule for next week? Attention Management: When are my best periods of proactive attention going to be?

Is there anything on my list that’s been hanging around for a few weeks? Do I need to redefine the action to give it more clarity? Ruthlessness: Delete three things from my Master Actions List simply because they’re not mission-critical. Let anyone else relevant know that I’m doing this (and my reason!). Delegate three things from my Master Actions List that someone else could just as easily do. Resistance: Is there anything here I’m resisting? What makes it/them challenging? What is going to give me the momentum I need? Could I cheat or move the goal posts? (Remember, unorthodoxy that gets the job done is fine!) What’s the smallest step forward I could take? How about just committing to that? Health & Fitness: Am I eating well? Am I drinking enough water? Am I getting the exercise I need? If not, where does this fit into my routine next week? Did I meditate or find time to completely switch off this week? When are my best opportunities to do that next week and how can I ensure they happen? How do I feel physically and emotionally? Are there any problems or issues I need to think about? Relationships: Am I spending enough time with family and friends? Am I happy when I do? If not, what would change this and how can I work towards it this week? Hobbies: Am I making time for hobbies? What’s coming up in the next week? Happiness: Am I happy, at least most of the time?

According to neuroscience experts, multitasking actually slows you down by 50 percent and increases your chances of making a mistake by 50 percent.","Another smart move is to prevent your mind from wandering by giving yourself a purpose. That way, you can easily remind yourself why you wanted to concentrate on something in the first place.","Once you’ve found a purpose, ask yourself questions so you become (i)nterested and (c)urious about what you’ve chosen to learn. “Is this currently relevant to my life?” or “Can I use this at work?” are great ones to start with.","let’s take the capital of Australia, Canberra. If you’re trying to remember it, visualize a KANgaroo eating some BERRies to help jog your memory.","So, for example, when you’re trying to remember the word “horse,” it’s important to imagine its skin, smell, touch and even its taste. That way, you’ve created a multisensory image that’s far easier to recall than five letters.","just use the SEE method. Information always enters our brains via our (s)enses.

That way, you’ve created a multisensory image that’s far easier to recall than five letters. Up next is (e)xaggeration. Compared to an ordinary horse, you’re more likely to remember a giant bright pink horse wearing a tux, right? Forget logic, it’s all about making funny, fantastical images. And lastly, (e)nergize. A horse galloping at full speed into the sunset is far more entertaining than one standing still in a stable. Adding a bit of action will make the information you’re trying to retain a lot more vivid.","Now that you’ve discovered how to create memorable images, it’s important to learn how to organize them in your mind. The best way to do this is to use the loci method, also knows as the route method, which is the practice of combining new information with something already familiar.","So, in each room you imaginarily venture to, pick three specific locations in the room, and put them in a specific order. In this way, as you go around your house, you combine each part of the speech with the locations you’ve picked.","Next, let’s say the following paragraph in your speech includes the words “summer camp,” which you remember by imagining your family pictures on the refrigerator.","First, you’ll need to learn a system that changes numbers into letters or alters how those letters sound. Take the number zero, which can be represented by the letters s, z and c. Tough to remember? Think about a hissing wheel. After all, zero looks like a wheel anyway! Each number from zero to nine can be assigned a group of similar sounding consonants. For instance, the number six can be represented by the sounds j, sh/ch or a soft g. You can also use the shape of the numbers when you assign the sounds to make them easier to remember. For instance, if you flip the numbers two and three on the side they look like the letters N and M respectively and if you flip the number 9 horizontally or vertically, it looks like a p or a b. Vowels are left out for now, but come into use later. The next step in remembering a date or number is to write down the letters that represent them and make up a word. Say you want to remember the year 1969, when humans first walked on the moon. Most memorable dates happened in the last millennia, so you only need to remember the 969 bit. Therefore, the sounds b, sh and p should come to mind. Together, they can be used to make the word BiSHoP. The last stage is to make a picture for you to remember. Using the SEE principle, take the word you’ve created and your chosen date or number. For the above, a bishop dancing on the moon with Neil Armstrong should do the trick!","To help the name stick, pick it apart and use any words that come to mind to create a memorable image. Take, for example, the author’s surname: Horsley. To remember his name, you might picture a fight between a HORSe and Bruce LEE.","To help the name stick, pick it apart and use any words that come to mind to create a memorable image. Take, for example, the author’s surname: Horsley. To remember his name, you might picture a fight between a HORSe and Bruce LEE. Once you’ve sorted your image, connect it to the person’s face whose name you’re trying to remember. That way, seeing their face will immediately bring up their name.","A great way to match a face to a name is to use the connection method. If the person has a striking feature, connect that to the name you’re trying to remember. If your colleague Janice has icy blue eyes, imagine icicles flying out of them! But what happens if you already know someone with that name? This is where the comparison method comes in. The key to this technique is to compare the new face to the one you know. Take two people with the name John. You could imagine both of their heads on one body, chatting to each other about how they look that day. Whichever method you use, make sure you revisit the names you’ve learned so that you use them continuously. It would also be handy to list the names in your diary or add the people whose names you’re trying to remember on your favorite social media channel."]},{"title":"Rebel Ideas by Blinkist","author":"Blinkist","highlights":["This subconscious habit, known as homophily, occurs because it’s validating to have our own ideas reflected back to us by the people around us, whether it’s friends, family or colleagues.","Denniston hired demographers to crack German codes. The team noticed that each encryption began with three letters that weren’t part of the message. These letters revealed the cipher settings on the German encryption machine. After considering where a signal operator’s mind might go in a moment of extreme pressure, the team realized that the letters were taken from either the beginning of a German girl’s name – probably a girlfriend – or a swear word.

This is called being proactive, and it’s the first habit of highly effective people. When you’re proactive, you have the freedom to choose how to engage with the world around you and the opportunity to determine your own destiny. For instance, you can let unexpected rain ruin your picnic plans. Or you can proactively focus on the positives. Rather than brood about the weather, you can direct your energy toward enjoying time with your friends, despite the storm.","Begin every task with a desired outcome. Let’s begin with a slightly morbid mental exercise: Imagine that it’s three years in the future, and, sadly enough, you’ve passed away. Yes, it’s a tragedy.

In their view, a person’s abilities are set in stone from the get-go; a person is, by nature, either intelligent and talented or stupid and incompetent, and will stay that way.","People with a growth mindset relish any opportunity to learn tricks from the crème de la crème in a field. They reconsider and discard strategies used in the past, and are always thinking about how they can eradicate their faults and weaknesses.","In their relationships, they encourage their partners to continue learning and working on themselves. When they play sports, they play knowing they are serving the team. When they run a business, they show their employees respect, are grateful for their work, and ask for their honest opinions on things, however inconvenient the truth may be. People with a growth mindset welcome problems and see them as challenges, not insurmountable obstacles. They willingly put their energy into bettering themselves and the world around them.","People with a fixed mindset seek approval; those with a growth mindset seek development.","People with a fixed mindset do not believe they can learn from their mistakes. They see a single failure as evidence that they will be losers forever: one defeat negates and devalues all past successes.","He firmly believed that he could transform his defeats into victories – as long as he tried hard enough. The fixed mindset sees failures as disasters; the growth mindsetsees them as opportunities.","impossible for people with a fixed mindset to better themselves without questioning their own talent – and so they avoid difficult situations. They do not want to potentially make a fool of themselves.","Challenges give people with a growth mindset the opportunity to pursue purpose-filled actions. The more dejected they are, the more energy they put into fighting against – and rewriting – their fate. Like Reeve, they strive to make the impossible possible. People with a fixed mindset avoid difficulties; those with a growth mindset relish them.","Parents with a growth mindset encourage their children and urge them to continue learning, whereas those with a fixed mindset are always judging their children, telling them what is right or wrong, good or bad.","Our mindset is not entirely predetermined. It can change as early as childhood when we adopt the mindsets of our role models. Our mindset is often strongly influenced by the role models we had as children.","Nobody has to be a victim of her surroundings when developing her own mindset. The brain can be trained like any other muscle: if we want a growth mindset, we can teach ourselves to think that way one step at a time.","Here’s an example: you accidentally drop a plate on the floor. The first – fixed – thought might be, “I’m so clumsy!” But people who are conscious of this reaction and want to change it can push themselves to adopt a growth mindset by thinking, “Oh well, these things happen. I’ll clean it up and be more careful next time.”","Working towards a growth mindset presents a great opportunity to reach out to others for support, to talk about our faults and mistakes, and to make viable, concrete plans for achieving our goals. It is important to understand that a fixed mindset is not easy to kick. It has likely become an emotional crutch over the years: it protects us from failure, creates recognition in the eyes of our parents and partners, and boosts our self-confidence. It comforts us time and again, so getting rid of it can be extremely discomforting."]},{"title":"Pitch Anything by Blinkist","author":"Blinkist","highlights":["The one critical thing you need throughout your pitch is the attention of your target. To successfully attain this, research has shown that you must evoke two sensations in your pitch: desire and tension. Desire arises when you offer your target a reward, and tension arises when you show them they might lose something, like an opportunity, as a result of this social encounter. On a neurological level, this effectively floods your target’s brain with two neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine.","Dopamine is a chemical associated with anticipating rewards — desire. One such reward would be the pleasure of understanding something new, such as solving a puzzle. Thus, to increase the level of dopamine in your target’s brain, you must introduce novelty through a pleasant surprise, like an unexpected yet entertaining product demo.","Norepinephrine, on the other hand, is the chemical responsible for alertness and it creates tension in the target. If your pitch convinces them that there is a lot at stake here, their brains will be flooded with norepinephrine. To create tension, you must create a bit of low level conflict with a push-pull strategy. This means first saying something to push the target away, like, “Maybe we aren’t a good match for each other.” You then counter this by pulling the target back toward you with something like, “But if we are, that would be terrific.”","Typically, your target will use the power frame which exudes arrogance. You must not do anything that validates the other person’s power. Instead, use small acts of defiance and denial to bust the frame; for example, by yanking your presentation material away from the target if they do not seem to be taking it seriously. Another oft-used frame is the time frame, where your customer asserts control over time: “I only have ten more minutes.” This is meant to push you off balance, but you can always counter with: “That’s fine, I only have five.” A particularly lethal frame is the analyst frame, denoted by a fixation on details and numbers. If your opponent is in this frame, they will likely insist on drilling down into minor technical and financial details, effectively bogging down your pitch. In such situations, give a direct but high-level answer to the question asked and get right back to your pitch. Analysis comes later.","intrigue frame. This basically means you tell a compelling personal story and leave it unfinished as a cliffhanger: “… so there we were, in a pitch black, falling airplane with no idea what was going to happen. Anyway, back to the pitch …\" This redirects the focus of the room","Typically when you’re selling something or pitching an idea, your target will tend to see their money as the “prize” of the meeting, something you have to fight for. You must reframe the situation so that you are the prize and they would be lucky to do business with you.","“I am very particular about with whom I work. Why should I do business with you?”","After you’ve introduced your big pitch idea, you want to trigger hot cognitions within your target. These will make him or her want what you have to offer in mere seconds, instead of analyzing your pitch for days to reach a rational, cold decision. You trigger the hot cognitions by stacking frames, meaning you introduce multiple frames in quick succession.","instead of trying to impress them, make them qualify themselves to you. You could say something like, “This deal has so many investors after it, I have to choose who to take on board.”","First, try to eliminate your desires, at least in the eyes of the target. If they have something you desperately want, this will translate as neediness in you. To negate this, make it clear to the target that you do not need them.","Second, focus on the things you do well, your strengths. Demonstrate something that showcases your excellence.","Third, withdraw. At the crucial moment when your target expects you to chase them for their money,","Often your pitch targets will lay so-called beta traps to force you into the situational beta position; for example, being made to wait in the lobby is a classic beta trap. You must try to ignore these traps","Namely, you must explain why now is the right time to invest.","If you know what you are doing, you can pitch anything in twenty.","economic, social and technological forces which make your deal unmissable right now. Economic forces that benefit your pitch, for example, could be your target customers becoming wealthier and interest rates going down, the social forces could be the rising consumer concern for the environment, and the technological force could be the development of the electric car. You must present these forces in a way that shows a window of opportunity has recently opened but will not remain open forever.","“For [target customers] who are dissatisfied with [current offerings on the market].

You also need to consider what value you’re offering your customer and who your competitors are.","“I have six honest servants... Their names are what, why, and who, and when and where and how.” – Robert Louis Stevenson","So, how can we create an original phrase? One way is to use “Spell Chuck,” and discard the normal way of spelling things. For some reason, beauty salons seem to be very good at this: Consider Shear Genius, Curl up and Dye and Cut and Dried. Another way of creating an original phrase is to run your core words through the alphabet, from A to Z, and keep modifying the first syllable until you find something that corresponds with your idea or product. For example, the word entrepreneur can be transformed into a variety of trademarkable terms – a spiritual business owner could be a “Zenpreneur,” for example. You can extend this wordplay approach and try playing with the last syllable, or add a prefix (e.g., re-, multi-, pre-) or suffix (e.g., –ly, -ology, -ish) to your core words. For example, consider the new word re-newlyweds that describes couples who have renewed their wedding vows later in their marriage and are “wed” once more.","Review your core words and try to find new words that form a series of alliterations. You can also run the first syllables of each word through the alphabet to potentially create an interesting neologism while you’re at it.","In an iamb, or iambic meter, we accent every other beat in a sequence, as in “Ta DUM, Ta DUM, Ta DUM.” Try reading the following commercial jingle out loud to understand iambic meter: “Double your pleasure, double your fun, with Doublemint, Doublemint, Doublemint gum.”","what do your current or future customers say or think when they experience the need your idea fills? What could a possible “Eureka!” or “At last!” moment feel like, when the customer’s problem is finally properly addressed?","pay close attention and learn from the humorous moments around you.

The brand Gorilla Glue answered this question with an 800-pound gorilla, which became a powerful symbol in their ads.","metaphors is to focus on the three A’s: Avocation (e.g., a hobby), Achievement and Adversity. To do this exercise, you need to take a fresh piece of paper and on it, draw three vertical lines. Use one column for avocations you are passionate about, one for your proudest achievements and one for all the adversities you have faced so far. Now look for similarities and connections between the columns. Can you create analogies and use past experiences to create stories that better explain what you’re trying to say? A good example of the power of this method is how a business executive used his flying lessons as an example to curb micromanaging in his company. He told his managers how his flying teacher never took the yoke out of his hands – not even in critical situations – but instead gave general instructions and let him figure it out. “Let them fly the plane” thus became an expression in the company for “stop micromanaging.”","How does my product address a topic no one wants to talk about?","One way of doing this is to create a powerful history behind your idea. Think back to when you came up with your idea, product or brand. What did you feel, say or do? Where did your ideas come to you, who inspired you?

Fertility declines with age, so women who start their families later in life tend to have fewer children.","The African continent has a current population of 1.3 billion. That’s projected to rise to 2 billion by 2038 and 3 billion by 2061, with the boom concentrated in the sub-Saharan region.","Here’s the key message: Aging consumers will have more spending power than ever before.","In Asia and the developing world, the middle classes will be booming.

Relish the good sides of being small, but don’t forget you are running a business. Less is more – start saying no and keep your product lean. Don’t emulate big corporations in your marketing and communications – be honest, personal and nimble. What is the new way of building and running a business? Create an environment where people manage themselves and communicate with each other honestly. Don’t over-plan – stay agile with quick and flexible decisions. Productivity doesn’t stem from long hours, but rather from focused work and quick wins. Hire people only when absolutely necessary, and forget about resumes – trust your instincts."]},{"title":"Start with Why by Blinkist","author":"Blinkist","highlights":["The key message here is: Manipulating consumers brings short-term benefits but undermines firms’ long-term viability. Manipulation comes in different forms. In general, it’s anything that pushes consumers to buy – think clearance sales, two-for-one deals, advertising hype, or appeals to authority in claims like “Four out of five dentists prefer Trident.” It’s a popular strategy – and in the short term, at least, it’s pretty effective.","The lower your prices, the more reluctant your customers will be to pay more. The result: slimmer margins that can only be offset by more sales, which in turn require even lower prices.","Worse, manipulation might be able to drive transactions – individual sales – but it doesn’t breed loyalty. You can see why when you think of how rewards work. When you lose your kitten and offer a reward to whoever returns it to you, for example, you’re not trying to build a relationship with the finder – you just want your cat back.","Companies like Apple don’t just sell products. They affirm their customers’ beliefs and values.","If Apple were like most other companies, its pitch would be simple: “We make great computers, they’re beautifully designed and user-friendly – wanna buy one?”","“Everything we do is about challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently, and we prove this by making beautiful, user-friendly products. Oh, and we also happen to make great computers. Wanna buy one?”","Our rational brain doesn’t control our decisions. If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, you’ll see three areas. On the outside is the most recently evolved part, the neocortex. This is responsible for rational thought and language. The two middle sections make up the limbic brain. These are responsible for feelings like loyalty and trust, as well as decision-making. Crucially, these older areas lack the capacity for language. That’s why it’s so hard to describe why you love someone.","when we take our clothes out of the machine, we don’t hold them up to the light to inspect how white or bright they are. We smell them.

This is called the law of diffusion, a concept that goes back to a 1962 book by communications theorist Everett M. Rogers. His theory states that every population can be divided into five segments, each of which responds differently to innovation. Innovators, who make up 2.5 percent of the population, are the first to embrace novelty. The next 13.5 percent are early adopters. Then come the more risk-averse early majority and the late majority. Together, they account for 68 percent of the population. The final 16 percent are laggards – folks who only buy touch-tone phones because rotary phones don’t exist anymore.","the majority won’t try something until someone else has recommended it to them. If you want to reach the middle of society, you need a minority of loyalists to get the word out – something they’ll only do if they believe in your why.","This is one of the risks of achieving so much. As success follows success, companies become more and more confident about what they’re doing and forget why they’re doing it."]},{"title":"No Rules Rules by Blinkist","author":"Blinkist","highlights":["The Netflix culture values people, prioritizes innovation, and has few control mechanisms.","Perhaps most impressively, it’s responded nimbly to four seismic industry shifts.

From there, Netflix began licensing original content produced by other studios, and finally, it began producing its own in-house movies and TV shows.","True freedom comes from careful planning. Three things are necessary to unlock the potential of radical employee freedom and the responsibility that comes with it. First, high talent density. Next, high levels of candor between employees and managers. And finally, the courage to remove controls which waste everyone’s time – and company money.","A company with really dense talent is one everyone wants to work for because high performers thrive in an environment with other high performers. It holds people to a higher standard, and it’s more fun.","According to Bill Gates, the best software engineers add 100 times the value of a normal one.","at Netflix, if you don’t speak up when you disagree, it’s as if you are purposely being disloyal to the company. You could help the business be better, but you’re choosing not to.","To be effective, you have to follow four rules. First, give feedback with the aim of helping. Second, your feedback should be actionable. Third, when receiving feedback, you should appreciate the effort and bravery of your colleague speaking up.

Accountants, for example, aren’t allowed to take time off in January when the annual books are due.","he did away with the approval system for expenses and travel.","But to keep up the talent density, you have to do something extremely unpleasant: fire people who are merely adequate.","For Hastings, Netflix’s talent-dense team isn’t a family. Jobs aren’t something you should have for life, through thick and thin, regardless of your performance. A job is something you do for a magical period of time when you’re the best person for the job and the job is the best position for you. Instead of a family, Netflix employees think of themselves as a professional sports team aiming for the championship. Every player is the best performer possible in that position.","But job loss not only impacts someone’s career but also their personal finances and morale. Isn’t it cruel to take firing someone so lightly? Well, sort of. That’s why Netflix offers generous severance packages.

So make sure you know exactly what you’re trying to achieve.","Generally speaking, there are two big categories of questions. First, we have softball questions. Softball questions are easy questions that give your counterpart lots of room to answer and typically don’t aim at making a point. They are non-leading, meaning they include words like who, what, and when, allowing the questioned person to guide the direction of their answer. A good example of a non-leading, softball question is: “So, governor, what inspired you to run for office?”","Softball questions can help you map out the ground for the debate. They show your conversation partners that you’re interested in what they have to say, and can lead into your argument in a neutral way. For example, “Honey, when did you last take the trash out?” is a pretty inoffensive way to start a broader conversation on household duties.","Why can change everything. Just consider if you asked someone why they killed their husband. How would you react if they said, “because he was abusing our children”? What if instead they said, “because he was snoring”? The difference is monumental.","This is where hardball questions come in. These are leading questions that put the focus on the question itself rather than the answer. Consider the question: “Didn’t I tell you to take out the trash this morning?” The question itself already implies the answer is yes.","you can latch onto a higher ideal, like family values, fairness, or justice, you can get sincerely passionate about the smallest of issues.","Impeachment via facts can be as simple as asking your opponent how he’s come to know what he’s claiming. If you can show that his so-called “facts” are really just hearsay, his argument suffers a huge blow.","If your opponent’s facts are correct, but she still reaches a completely different conclusion than you, you may have to use the second method of impeachment: disputing her logic.","impeachment of character. Ideally, you’re trying to prove to an audience that your opponent is habitually lying, unfavorably biased, or morally corrupt.","it’s rarely a good idea to use big, generalizing words like everybody, always, or never.","Repackaging is when you reduce an argument to absurdity by putting it in different words.","“So you’re saying it’s her fault she was abused?”","The key message here is: If your argument is failing, divert, deconstruct, double-down, or play the victim.","try to challenge each tiny assumption they make. Questions like “How do you know that?” and “How can you be sure of this?” will slow down your opponent tremendously.","you have a fact or argument on your side that works particularly well, just double down. Actually, you can keep on doubling and doubling down until you figure out how to get out of the argument.","If all else fails, you can always play strategy number four: the victim card.","“How do you think it makes me feel when you misrepresent my faith and my spiritual beliefs?”","That’s what the art of persuasion is all about.

Business owners therefore extract “surplus value” from the work of the proletariat.","Schumpeter pointed to a few problems with Marx’s theory. First, it leaves no room for a third class of people essential to capitalism: entrepreneurs. Capitalism is driven by smart and energetic people who don’t necessarily belong to the bourgeoisie, but wish to ascend to it. With their ideas and innovations, entrepreneurs are constantly revolutionizing the system from within.","All in all, then, big business and even monopolistic practices have largely improved our lives.","Finally, capitalism encourages hard work, innovation, and invention. This means that we have capitalism to thank for our high standard of living, our rational mindset, and our greatest inventions, such as refrigerators, airplanes, and even radio and television.","competition was not based only on price – it also took into account product quality and advertising. And, above all, he viewed capitalism as a process. To him, the system was subject to constant innovation and destruction.","In a socialist society, the means of production are controlled by just one central authority, rather than by many private actors.","the government could set up a pricing authority for each industry whose decisions would be based on customer demand. And as for consumers themselves, they could even receive different “incomes,” depending on how much they worked.","Democracy is a way of making political decisions by letting individuals compete for people’s votes, in order to gain the power to implement those decisions.","The first condition for the success of democracy is the availability of high-quality leaders. This means that the political sphere of a country should be accessible and appealing enough to attract the right kind of people – individuals who are smart, conscientious, and capable.","The second condition is that political decisions made democratically should stay within an appropriate range. The government should decide some things about public life, but not all of them.","democracy only works smoothly if all people accept the way decisions are made, and are able to tolerate differences in opinion.","Under capitalism, progress is becoming increasingly automated and predictable. For example, capitalist progress diminishes the figure of the business owner. Instead, it hands over control to an impersonal structure of managers, executives, and stockholders. In such a world, where running a business becomes an abstraction, why even try? As the cost of living increases, and as businesses focus on small niches, not revolutionary innovation, there’s less and less incentive for true entrepreneurial leadership.","If you don’t have children, you don’t really need long-term investments like property. And that gives you the incentive to earn, and save, less. That's no good for the constant economic growth that capitalism requires."]},{"title":"The Art of War by Blinkist","author":"Blinkist","highlights":["Which of the two rulers of the states at war commands complete accord and obedience from his people so that they will follow him even to their deaths? Which of the two generals is more capable? Which side has advantages of heaven and earth, meaning of circumstances like the weather, distances to be covered and the nature of the terrain? Which side enforces the discipline of its men more strongly? Which side has the stronger army? Which side has the better trained officers and men? Which side has more consistency in giving rewards and punishments to enforce discipline?","A skillful fighter avoids battles he may lose, thus ensuring he is never defeated.","You must know when to fight and when not to fight. You must know how to deal with forces both inferior and superior to your own. Your army must have a strong, uniform fighting spirit and discipline throughout its ranks. You must fight so that you are prepared and the enemy is unprepared. You must have the military capacity and freedom to command your troops without interference from a sovereign.","Never enter battle simply out of anger; there must always be something to be won. Your anger will eventually fade, but a kingdom once destroyed can never be brought back to life.","The general is also responsible if any of these six calamities befall an army: If he hurls his army against a force ten times its size, causing his soldiers to flee. If his soldiers are too strong in relation to the officers, causing insubordination. If the soldiers are too weak, leading to them being worn down by officers and collapsing. If the higher officers are angry and undisciplined, leading them to attack on their own accord and cause the ruin of the army. If the general is weak and indecisive, resulting in a weak, disorganized army. If the general is unable to estimate an enemy’s strength and hurls an inferior force against a superior one, leading to overwhelming defeat.","The art of war is based on deception. You must mask strength with weakness, courage with timidity and order with disorder. Confuse your enemy and let him grow careless.","Have your troops feign disorder when in reality they are highly disciplined. When you draw close to your enemy, make it seem like you are far away. When you are able to attack, make it seem like you are unable. Play with your enemy as a cat plays with a mouse. If he has a temper, irritate him. If he is at ease, harass him; if well supplied, starve him; if quietly encamped, force him to move. If you wish the enemy to advance, hold out bait to him; and if you wish him to retreat, inflict damage on him.","When the soldiers he sends to gather water start by drinking it themselves, they are suffering from thirst.","As a general, you must be secretive.

The Hydra was a many-headed serpent which tormented the ancient world. Each time one of these heads was cut off in battle, two would grow back in its place. So every time the beast was harmed, it benefitted; the Hydra was therefore antifragile. Unlike fragile items, which break when put under stress, antifragile items actually benefit from volatility and shock.","the economy itself is antifragile. For the economy to grow, it needs some of these parts to fail. The failure of a start-up in the coffee making business, for example, will make that industry stronger overall, as other coffee manufacturers learn from their mistakes.","When we exercise we put our bodies through unusual stress. In doing this, our bodies react to the shock and grow stronger. In this way our bodies are antifragile.","When confronted by stressors, in this case weights or a treadmill, an antifragile system will respond by overcompensating: it will improve its capacity to deal with possible future shocks. This is a crucial element of antifragility; strength comes from overcompensating against adversity.","Tranquil environments result in fragile systems – antifragility stems from volatility.","In order to make yourself antifragile, you have to accept this and try to “domesticate” the uncertainty, rather than avoid or eliminate it. The best way to achieve this is to follow a barbell strategy: much as a barbell has weights on both ends but nothing in the middle, you must prepare for extremes, both negative and positive, and ignore the middle path.","The larger the organisation or system is, the harder it will be hit by unexpected crises.","Another flaw in our thinking is that we assume the worst event we have witnessed must be the worst that could ever happen. This leads to contingency plans and fail-safes based on this worst-case scenario. It doesn’t occur to many people that a bigger event could happen in the future; an event that they’d be wholly unaware of.","If you want to know what an expert really thinks will happen, find out where he puts his own assets.

However, there is not a single piece of empirical data to suggest that vulnerability is associated with weakness. In fact, the opposite is true: acts of courage are impossible without first putting yourself in a vulnerable position.","As Golden Globe-winning actress and writer Amy Poehler points out, it’s very difficult to let yourself be vulnerable, and those who can are often society’s dreamers, thinkers and creators.","One of the most important things the author has learned from years of studying leadership is that leaders need to spend a significant amount of time communicating about their subordinates’ feelings and fears. If they fail to do this, they can expect to spend even more time attempting to manage their workforce’s unproductive and ineffective behavior.","try to stop talking. This may feel uncomfortable, but have faith that, when they’re ready, the other person will fill the silences with their true thoughts.","The most courageous leaders that the author came across during her research were those who had the most clarity about what their values were. During times of uncertainty and vulnerability, their values were an important support to them, a ‘North Star’ that helped guide them through periods of darkness.","The author, for example, narrowed hers down to the key values of courage and faith.","seven separate behaviors that encourage trust, expressed together with the acronym BRAVING. BRAVING can be a useful way to inventory strengths and areas for improvement in working relationships with subordinates. So, what are these behaviors? The B stands for boundaries. This element of trust involves respecting others’ boundaries. If either party is unsure of the other’s boundaries, they ask whether or not something is okay, and the other person feels comfortable enough to say no if it isn’t. The R stands for reliability, or doing what we say we will. In a work context, this translates into being aware of our abilities and limitations so that we don’t end up overpromising and under-delivering on commitments. The A stands for accountability. We take ownership of our mistakes, apologize for them and try our best to make amends. The V stands for vault. We can think of ourselves as a vault of information that other people have shared with us over time. An important aspect of trust is not passing on information that is not ours to pass on. Other people need to trust that we will keep their confidences and also need to see that we are not sharing other’s confidential information with them. The I stands for integrity - choosing courage instead of comfort, and doing what is right rather than what is easy, fun or expedient. It also means practicing the same values that we preach. The N stands for non-judgment, which means people know that they can tell us how they really feel or ask for help without expecting us to judge them for doing so. The G stands for generosity, being consistently generous in our interpretation of the words, actions and intentions of others. People are more likely to trust us if they know we always see the best in others, rather than the worst.","the author’s own company she makes it a priority to teach failing and resilience skills as part of the onboarding process for new recruits. It’s the company’s way of telling new joiners that bravery is expected, thus failure is also expected once in a while.","perfectionism is really about attempting to win approval. Most perfectionists are raised in environments that praise their exceptional performance, for example in athletics or school. As a result, perfectionists develop a damaging belief system that follows them into their adult lives, anchoring their whole sense of self in accomplishments and brilliant execution.","This locks perfectionists into an exhausting behavioral pattern of pleasing people, perfecting efforts, performing for others and proving themselves. People with a healthy drive for success, on the other hand, are much more self-focused and inspired by asking themselves how they can improve.

So a strong WHY for this young woman would be a career in protecting vulnerable people who can’t protect themselves.","With the right probing questions, something like “As a child, I loved visiting my cousins during summer vacation,” can become, “I loved visiting my cousins because we could explore the woods along their property and find fascinating things in nature.” With these details, common themes can emerge and point the way to your WHY.","Employees were urged to share stories that reflected how it felt to work for the company. One employee recalled a photography event at the store that brought the staff together and made them feel connected.","This story triggered many others just like it, and La Marzocco’s WHY statement soon came into focus: to bring people together over coffee for lively conversation.","By sharing their stories of what the store meant to them today, the WHY became a spark for innovation and helped create opportunities for everyone in the community.","So, once you have an understanding of your purpose in life, it’s time to look to the HOWs.","To uncover your HOWs, think about your day-to-day activities and how your behavior is helping you achieve your WHY.","Co-author Peter Docker’s WHY is to help make it possible for others to do extraordinary things, and he has a few HOWs to make this happen. These include reaching new frontiers, creating strong relationships, simplifying things and never losing sight of the larger context.","The author, Simon Sinek, knows how to focus on the long term, but this HOW can be broken down – more precisely, Sinek focuses on creating products, services and ideas that will continue to be used long after he’s gone. It also means he’s less focused on deadlines and ways to make a quick profit, and more interested in building lasting momentum for his company."]},{"title":"Quiet by Blinkist","author":"Blinkist","highlights":["As a result of this complex way of perceiving, highly sensitive people find profound conversations about values and morals far more stimulating than the superficial anecdotes of a colleague’s recent vacation. While extroverts engage in small talk, introverts discuss climate change.","Consequently, introverts have a strict moral conscience: they are aware of how their behavior affects others and tend to take their own mistakes to heart. To these highly sensitive individuals, it means a lot to be seen positively by others, which makes it unusually difficult for them to meet new people or be interviewed.","So how can parents better attend to the needs of their introverted children?

Classes proceed far more smoothly for her this way, too.","Extroverted team leaders, although successful in getting their team to adhere precisely to the rules and work by the book to achieve great performance levels, were less successful in responding to individuals’ suggestions – for example, how the T-shirts could be folded more quickly and efficiently. Among the introverted team leaders, the study showed the exact opposite. Although their calm, quiet character made it difficult for them to encourage their comrades and boost their efficiency level, they were more open to their team’s ideas and used all available means to put good suggestions into action.","When quick decisions must be made, extroverted leaders are the best; when careful consideration is called for, it’s better to follow an introvert."]},{"title":"Surrounded by Idiots by Blinkist","author":"Blinkist","highlights":["The first personality is known as the Red personality, and it’s the type Hippocrates referred to as choleric. This type of person is characterized by ambition, dominance, decisiveness, competitiveness and an often hot temper.","Next is the Yellow personality type, which Hippocrates called sanguine, a word that means optimistic, cheerful and confident – all of which describe Yellows to a T. When others are despairing, Yellows will continue to see the possibilities and find ways to enjoy themselves.","The third personality type is Green, known in Hippocrates’s day as the phlegmatic temperament. These types are known for their calm, balanced, easygoing, tolerant and friendly natures. The popular phrase “keep calm and carry on” might well be the motto of the Greens. And, unlike Yellows, Greens are good listeners.","Finally, there are the Blues, the type Hippocrates called melancholic. Some might refer to Blues as pessimists, though Blues are more likely to call themselves realists. They also tend to be perfectionists who pay so much attention to the fine details that it sometimes slows down their work. While they are often analyzing a situation silently, they’re also known to keep their thoughts to themselves unless directly asked to speak up.","Blue and Red tend to place importance on tasks and issues. On the bottom, Green and Yellow tend to focus on people and relationships.","it’s rare that you’ll find Green/Red or Blue/Yellow. In fact, it’s wise not to pair up these conflicting personalities unless you want to see sparks fly.","Reds are ambitious and quick to express their opinions, they can be perceived as rude, impatient and aggressive – or even as tyrannical control freaks.","manage to interfere with the daily breakfast or lunch routine that a Green has set, there’s a good chance you’ve ruined the rest of his day.","be seen as stubbornly resistant to change and indifferent to or unconcerned about problems that may arise.","So a task that might take a non-detail-oriented Yellow an hour to do can easily take a Blue the better part of a day.","Yellows. Now that you’re more familiar with the kinds of behavior that characterize the four personality types, you should be better able to recognize each one in the office, at a conference or within your own family. So now we can start to look at ways you can adapt your own behavior in order to communicate with them more effectively. No matter whom you’re dealing with, delivering feedback or constructive criticism can be difficult. So let’s start by looking at how to do so with each personality type. In some ways, Reds are the easiest to talk to since you don’t have to butter them up or figure out how to transition to your main point. Reds","speak up and tell them what they’re doing wrong, and be prepared to back up your criticism with concrete examples.","Reds can be stubborn or overly impulsive, so you may need to tell/advise them to be more grown-up or professional in their behavior.","When it comes to meeting a Yellow, you’ll also be better off if you come well-prepared with an agenda and a list of main points that the person can take with her","try to be open, amiable and willing to laugh at their jokes, as this kind of behavior will lead to a receptive and open Yellow who feels at ease.","have the person across the table write down what you agreed upon and send it back to you to make sure she received the message you intended – but this is an especially good idea after talking to a Yellow.","if you want to communicate well with Greens, make sure you avoid putting the spotlight on them.","Greens already tend to be fearful people. Much of their behavior is based on their fear of conflict and trying to avoid it. But they also tend to have fragile egos, and their capacity for self-criticism is strong enough without someone else chiming in. As a result, they can end up agreeing with your criticism so strongly that you start to feel sorry and backpedal. Don’t fall into this trap. Instead, make sure you’re clear that this isn’t anything personal – it’s just a friendly conversation about making some adjustments.","Greens like clear instructions far more than they like taking the initiative. And since they don’t like change, try to make your directives a series of small steps that they can take over time in order to arrive at the solution.","If you want to impress a Blue, you’ll need to have your facts straight and be able to provide meticulous details.

It can be broken down into two parts. The first is the ability to “envision” and dream; that is, to create a clear and bold image of how the leader wants things to be in the long term without the impediment of conventional limits. This includes depth in terms of a lengthy timescale and breadth in terms of a whole-systems mindset, making connections beyond boundaries. The second part of vision is the ability to communicate this image in such a way as to inspire others – to be “visionary.” It is through the communication of vision and the resulting inspiration that followership is created, for what is a leader without followers?","The next essential leadership quality is authenticity: when a person is who they really are,","Roberto Assagioli’s definition of the “I” was a place inside of pure consciousness (awareness) and pure will (responsibility).

Nevertheless, once the debate is over, everyone needs to be committed to the agreed decision.","So leaders for the future need to have values and vision and to be authentic and agile and internally aligned. Add awareness and responsibility to the mix, self-belief, and a good measure of emotional intelligence, and it’s a powerful recipe.","It is a common misconception that good leaders are born, not made, or that a coaching style is the preserve of people who possess certain natural traits.","Unconscious incompetence = low performance, no differentiation or understanding. • Conscious incompetence = low performance, recognition of flaws, and weak areas. • Conscious competence = improved performance, conscious, somewhat contrived effort. • Unconscious competence = natural, integrated, automatic higher performance.","Performance, learning, and enjoyment are inextricably intertwined.","A businessperson may be focused on personal achievement and success in the material world and may have become a well-integrated person, a good parent, and a respected member of society, without ever having asked themselves a meaningful question about life. The businessperson might regard the opposite type as lazy, disorganized, a sponger, a dilettante. The opposite type of person leads a contemplative and ascetic life, but seems ill equipped to cope with the realities and essentials of the everyday world. Their home, their finances, and even their personality may be in a bit of a mess. These people live a monastic life of study or art, and readily give gentle assistance to others. They see the businessperson’s pursuits as pointless, ego driven, and often destructive to themselves and to others.","If social pressures, business imperatives, or blind determination to achieve override the tension that is attempting to pull us back on track, we are liable eventually to run into a wake-up wall.

This glue has made us the masters of creation.","a Stone Age woman came across a tree groaning with figs, the most sensible thing to do was to eat as many of them as she could on the spot, before the local baboon band picked the tree bare. The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes.","A 15,000-year bond has yielded a much deeper understanding and affection between humans and dogs than between humans and any other animal.","The human collective knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skilful people in history.","There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging.5 Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone.","Average life expectancy was apparently just thirty to forty years, but this was due largely to the high incidence of child mortality. Children who made it through the perilous first years had a good chance of reaching the age of sixty, and some even made it to their eighties. Among modern foragers, forty-five-year-old women can expect to live another twenty years, and about 5–8 per cent of the population is over sixty.6","The peasant’s ancient ancestor, the forager, may have eaten berries and mushrooms for breakfast; fruits, snails and turtle for lunch; and rabbit steak with wild onions for dinner.","Since eucalyptuses regenerate after fire particularly well, they spread far and wide while other trees disappeared.","During the last million years, there has been an ice age on average every 100,000 years. The last one ran from about 75,000 to 15,000 years ago. Not unusually severe for an ice age, it had twin peaks, the first about 70,000 years ago and the second at about 20,000 years ago. The giant diprotodon appeared in Australia more than 1.5 million years ago and successfully weathered at least ten previous ice ages.","The first human footprint on a sandy Australian beach was immediately washed away by the waves. Yet when the invaders advanced inland, they left behind a different footprint, one that would never be expunged. As they pushed on, they encountered a strange universe of unknown creatures that included a 200-kilogram, two-metre kangaroo, and a marsupial lion, as massive as a modern tiger, that was the continent’s largest predator. Koalas far too big to be cuddly and cute rustled in the trees and flightless birds twice the size of ostriches sprinted on the plains. Dragon-like lizards and snakes five metres long slithered through the undergrowth. The giant diprotodon, a two-and-a-half-ton wombat, roamed the forests. Except for the birds and reptiles, all these animals were marsupials – like kangaroos, they gave birth to tiny, helpless, fetus-like young which they then nurtured with milk in abdominal pouches.","more than 90 per cent of the calories that feed humanity come from the handful of plants that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC – wheat, rice, maize (called ‘corn’ in the US), potatoes, millet and barley. No noteworthy plant or animal has been domesticated in the last 2,000 years.","The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.","Worldwide, wheat covers about 2.25 million square kilometres of the globe’s surface, almost ten times the size of Britain.","This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.","One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it.","The pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship, and not for the last time. It happens to us today. How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.","Around 10,000 BC, before the transition to agriculture, earth was home to about 5–8 million nomadic foragers. By the first century AD, only 1–2 million foragers remained (mainly in Australia, America and Africa), but their numbers were dwarfed by the world’s 250 million farmers.","These forfeited food surpluses fuelled politics, wars, art and philosophy. They built palaces, forts, monuments and temples. Until the late modern era, more than 90 per cent of humans were peasants who rose each morning to till the land by the sweat of their brows. The extra they produced fed the tiny minority of elites – kings, government officials, soldiers, priests, artists and thinkers – who fill the history books.","In 1776 BC Babylon was the world’s biggest city. The Babylonian Empire was probably the world’s largest, with more than a million subjects.","According to the science of biology, people were not ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’.","Evolution is based on difference, not on equality. Every person carries a somewhat different genetic code, and is exposed from birth to different environmental influences. This leads to the development of different qualities that carry with them different chances of survival. ‘Created equal’ should therefore be translated into ‘evolved differently’.","Many of them undergo constant mutations, and may well be completely lost over time. The ostrich is a bird that lost its ability to fly. So ‘unalienable rights’ should be translated into ‘mutable characteristics’.","But if we believe that we are all equal in essence, it will enable us to create a stable and prosperous society.’ I have no argument with that. This is exactly what I mean by ‘imagined order’. We believe in a particular order not because it is objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society.","Bear in mind, though, that Hammurabi might have defended his principle of hierarchy using the same logic: ‘I know that superiors, commoners and slaves are not inherently different kinds of people. But if we believe that they are, it will enable us to create a stable and prosperous society.’","At least some of the commanders and soldiers must truly believe in something, be it God, honour, motherland, manhood or money.","Even parents are forbidden to enter without knocking and asking permission. The room is decorated as the child sees fit, with rock-star posters on the wall and dirty socks on the floor. Somebody growing up in such a space cannot help but imagine himself ‘an individual’, his true worth emanating from within rather than from without.","The imagined order is embedded in the material world. Though the imagined order exists only in our minds, it can be woven into the material reality around us, and even set in stone. Most Westerners today believe in individualism. They believe that every human is an individual, whose worth does not depend on what other people think of him or her.","Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we must have as many different experiences as we can.","Romanticism, which encourages variety, meshes perfectly with consumerism. Their marriage has given birth to the infinite ‘market of experiences’, on which the modern tourism industry is founded.","For the imagined order is not a subjective order existing in my own imagination – it is rather an inter-subjective order, existing in the shared imagination of thousands and millions of people.","The imaginary friend exists solely in the child’s subjective consciousness, and when the child grows up and ceases to believe in it, the imaginary friend fades away.","The imaginary friend exists solely in the child’s subjective consciousness, and when the child grows up and ceases to believe in it, the imaginary friend fades away. The inter-subjective is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance.","Consequently, evolutionary pressures have adapted the human brain to store immense quantities of botanical, zoological, topographical and social information.","art of reading quipus has been lost.","By 2500 BC, kings were using cuneiform to issue decrees, priests were using it to record oracles, and less exalted citizens were using it to write personal letters.","The most important impact of script on human history is precisely this: it has gradually changed the way humans think and view the world. Free association and holistic thought have given way to compartmentalisation and bureaucracy.","But the hierarchy of rich and poor – which mandates that rich people live in separate and more luxurious neighbourhoods, study in separate and more prestigious schools, and receive medical treatment in separate and better-equipped facilities – seems perfectly sensible to many Americans and Europeans. Yet it’s a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family.","According to one theory, insect wings evolved millions of years ago from body protrusions on flightless bugs. Bugs with bumps had a larger surface area than those without bumps, and this enabled them to absorb more sunlight and thus stay warmer. In a slow evolutionary process, these solar heaters grew larger. The same structure that was good for maximum sunlight absorption – lots of surface area, little weight – also, by coincidence, gave the insects a bit of a lift when they skipped and jumped. Those with bigger protrusions could skip and jump further. Some insects started using the things to glide, and from there it was a small step to wings that could actually propel the bug through the air.","Ever since the French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both social equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off.","contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are the engines of cultural development, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species. Discord in our thoughts, ideas and values compels us to think, re-evaluate and criticise. Consistency is the playground of dull minds.","Cognitive dissonance is often considered a failure of the human psyche. In fact, it is a vital asset.","At the micro level, it seems that for every group of cultures that coalesces into a mega-culture, there’s a mega-culture that breaks up into pieces. The Mongol Empire expanded to dominate a huge swathe of Asia and even parts of Europe, only to shatter into fragments.","Today almost all humans share the same geopolitical system (the entire planet is divided into internationally recognised states); the same economic system (capitalist market forces shape even the remotest corners of the globe); the same legal system (human rights and international law are valid everywhere, at least theoretically); and the same scientific system (experts in Iran, Israel, Australia and Argentina have exactly the same views about the structure of atoms or the treatment of tuberculosis).","Tomatoes, chilli peppers and cocoa are all Mexican in origin; they reached Europe and Asia only after the Spaniards conquered Mexico. Julius Caesar and Dante Alighieri never twirled tomato-drenched spaghetti on their forks (even forks hadn’t been invented yet), William Tell never tasted chocolate, and Buddha never spiced up his food with chilli. Potatoes reached Poland and Ireland no more than 400 years ago.","Sioux chiefs (1905). Neither the Sioux nor any other Great Plains tribe had horses prior to 1492.","The first universal order to appear was economic: the monetary order. The second universal order was political: the imperial order. The third universal order was religious: the order of universal religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam.","Merchants, conquerors and prophets were the first people who managed to transcend the binary evolutionary division, ‘us vs them’, and to foresee the potential unity of humankind. For the merchants, the entire world was a single market and all humans were potential customers. They tried to establish an economic order that would apply to all, everywhere. For the conquerors, the entire world was a single empire and all humans were potential subjects. And for the prophets, the entire world held a single truth and all humans were potential believers. They too tried to establish an order that would be applicable for everyone everywhere.","The rise of cities and kingdoms and the improvement in transport infrastructure brought about new opportunities for specialisation. Densely populated cities provided full-time employment not just for professional shoemakers and doctors, but also for carpenters, priests, soldiers and lawyers.","a barter economy, every day the shoemaker and the apple grower will have to learn anew the relative prices of dozens of commodities. If 100 different commodities are traded in the market, then buyers and sellers will have to know 4,950 different exchange rates.","Money is anything that people are willing to use in order to represent systematically the value of other things for the purpose of exchanging goods and services. Money enables people to compare quickly and easily the value of different commodities (such as apples, shoes and divorces), to easily exchange one thing for another, and to store wealth conveniently.","money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.","History’s first known money – Sumerian barley money – is a good example. It appeared in Sumer around 3000 BC,","first coins in history were struck around 640 BC by King Alyattes of Lydia, in western Anatolia. These coins had a standardised weight of gold or silver, and were imprinted with an identification mark.","In the first century AD, Roman coins were an accepted medium of exchange in the markets of India, even though the closest Roman legion was thousands of kilometres away.","Once trade connects two areas, the forces of supply and demand tend to equalise the prices of transportable goods.","Merchants travelling between India and the Mediterranean would notice the difference in the value of gold. In order to make a profit, they would buy gold cheaply in India and sell it dearly in the Mediterranean. Consequently, the demand for gold in India would skyrocket, as would its value.","Even if Indians still had no real use for gold, the fact that Mediterranean people wanted it would be enough to make the Indians value it.","We do not trust the stranger, or the next-door neighbour – we trust the coin they hold. If they run out of coins, we run out of trust.","The Akkadian Empire did not last long after its founder’s death, but Sargon left behind an imperial mantle that seldom remained unclaimed. For the next 1,700 years, Assyrian, Babylonian and Hittite kings adopted Sargon as a role model, boasting that they, too, had conquered the entire world. Then, around 550 BC, Cyrus the Great of Persia came along with an even more impressive boast.","The benefits were sometimes salient – law enforcement, urban planning, standardisation of weights and measures – and sometimes questionable – taxes, conscription, emperor worship. But most imperial elites earnestly believed that they were working for the general welfare of all the empire’s inhabitants.","Imagine an Iberian of good stock living a century after the fall of Numantia.","More than 90 per cent of the population of China are seen by themselves and by others as Han.","During the modern era Europeans conquered much of the globe under the guise of spreading a superior Western culture. They were so successful that billions of people gradually adopted significant parts of that culture. Indians, Africans, Arabs, Chinese and Maori learned French, English and Spanish. They began to believe in human rights and the principle of self-determination, and they adopted Western ideologies such as liberalism, capitalism, Communism, feminism and nationalism.","Even if we were to completely disavow the legacy of a brutal empire in the hope of reconstructing and safeguarding the ‘authentic’ cultures that preceded it, in all probability what we will be defending is nothing but the legacy of an older and no less brutal empire. Those who resent the mutilation of Indian culture by the British Raj inadvertently sanctify the legacies of the Mughal Empire and the conquering sultanate of Delhi.","It is unlikely that humankind can deal with these challenges without global cooperation. It remains to be seen how such cooperation could be secured. Perhaps global cooperation can only be secured through violent clashes and the imposition of a new conquering empire.","The crucial historical role of religion has been to give superhuman legitimacy to these fragile structures. Religions assert that our laws are not the result of human caprice, but are ordained by an absolute and indisputable authority. This helps place at least some fundamental laws beyond challenge, thereby ensuring social stability.","First, it must espouse a universal superhuman order that is true always and everywhere. Second, it must insist on spreading this belief to everyone. In other words, it must be universal and missionary.","Much of ancient mythology is in fact a legal contract in which humans promise everlasting devotion to the gods in exchange for mastery over plants and animals","polytheistic religions (from the Greek: poly = many, theos = god). These religions understood the world to be controlled by a group of powerful gods, such as the fertility goddess, the rain god and the war god.","Animists thought that humans were just one of many creatures inhabiting the world. Polytheists, on the other hand, increasingly saw the world as a reflection of the relationship between gods and humans.","Polytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single power or law governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist religions recognised such a supreme power that stands behind all the different gods, demons and holy rocks. In classical Greek polytheism, Zeus, Hera, Apollo and their colleagues were subject to an omnipotent and all-encompassing power – Fate (Moira, Ananke). Nordic gods, too, were in thrall to Fate, which doomed them to perish in the cataclysm of Ragnarök (the Twilight of the Gods).","The big breakthrough came with Christianity. This faith began as an esoteric Jewish sect that sought to convince Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was their long-awaited messiah. However, one of the sect’s first leaders, Paul of Tarsus, reasoned that if the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, and if He had bothered to incarnate Himself in the flesh and to die on the cross for the salvation of humankind, then this is something everyone should hear about, not just Jews. It was thus necessary to spread the good word – the gospel – about Jesus throughout the world.","For dualists, it’s easy to explain evil. Bad things happen even to good people because the world is not governed single-handedly by a good God. There is an independent evil power loose in the world. The evil power does bad things.","Gautama developed a set of meditation techniques that train the mind to experience reality as it is, without craving. These practices train the mind to focus all its attention on the question ‘What am I experiencing now?’ rather than on ‘What would I rather be experiencing?’ It is difficult to achieve this state of mind, but not impossible.","The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise. If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam.","Chaotic systems come in two shapes. Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts. Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system. What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise.","There is no basis for thinking that the most successful cultures in history are necessarily the best ones for Homo sapiens. Like evolution, history disregards the happiness of individual organisms. And individual humans, for their part, are usually far too ignorant and weak to influence the course of history to their own advantage.","In the year 1500, there were about 500 million Homo sapiens in the entire world. Today, there are 7 billion.1 The total value of goods and services produced by humankind in the year 1500 is estimated at $250 billion, in today’s dollars.2 Nowadays the value of a year of human production is close to $60 trillion.3 In 1500, humanity consumed about 13 trillion calories of energy per day. Today, we consume 1,500 trillion calories a day.4 (Take a second look at those figures – human population has increased fourteenfold, production 240-fold, and energy consumption 115-fold.)","Throughout history, societies have suffered from two kinds of poverty: social poverty, which withholds from some people the opportunities available to others; and biological poverty, which puts the very lives of individuals at risk due to lack of food and shelter. Perhaps social poverty can never be eradicated, but in many countries around the world biological poverty is a thing of the past.","give humankind eternal life. Even if killing death seems a distant goal, we have already achieved things that were inconceivable a few centuries ago.","In seventeenth-century England, 150 out of every 1,000 newborns died during their first year, and a third of all children were dead before they reached fifteen.9 Today, only 5 out of 1,000 English babies die during their first year, and only 7 out of 1,000 die before age fifteen.10","Assuming that the amount of money is limited, and that it is impossible to finance both research projects, which one should be funded? There is no scientific answer to this question. There are only political, economic and religious answers.","Science is unable to set its own priorities. It is also incapable of determining what to do with its discoveries.","What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it to dominate the late modern world? There are two complementary answers to this question: modern science and capitalism. Europeans were used to thinking and behaving in a scientific and capitalist way even before they enjoyed any significant technological advantages.","European imperialists set out to distant shores in the hope of obtaining new knowledge along with new territories.","For 300 years, Europeans enjoyed undisputed mastery in America and Oceania, in the Atlantic and the Pacific. The only significant struggles in those regions were between different European powers.","Thanks to the work of people like William Jones and Henry Rawlinson, the European conquerors knew their empires very well. Far better, indeed, than any previous conquerors, or even than the native population itself. Their superior knowledge had obvious practical advantages. Without such knowledge, it is unlikely that a ridiculously small number of Britons could have succeeded in governing, oppressing and exploiting so many hundreds of millions of Indians for two centuries.","European scholars consequently surmised that the people who spoke the primordial language that gave birth to both Sanskrit and Persian (as well as to Greek, Latin, Gothic and Celtic) must have called themselves Aryans. Could it be a coincidence that those who founded the magnificent Indian, Persian, Greek and Roman civilisations were all Aryans?","Banks are allowed to loan $10 for every dollar they actually possess, which means that 90 per cent of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes.","The fact is, it’s not a deception, but rather a tribute to the amazing abilities of the human imagination. What enables banks – and the entire economy – to survive and flourish is our trust in the future.","The problem in previous eras was not that no one had the idea or knew how to use it. It was that people seldom wanted to extend much credit because they didn’t trust that the future would be better than the present.","1776 the Scottish economist Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, probably the most important economics manifesto of all time.","In the new capitalist creed, the first and most sacred commandment is: ‘The profits of production must be reinvested in increasing production.’","The mercantile empires were simply much shrewder in financing their conquests. Nobody wants to pay taxes, but everyone is happy to invest.","How exactly did the Dutch win the trust of the financial system? Firstly, they were sticklers about repaying their loans on time and in full, making the extension of credit less risky for lenders. Secondly, their country’s judicial system enjoyed independence and protected private rights – in particular private property rights. Capital trickles away from dictatorial states that fail to defend private individuals and their property. Instead, it flows into states upholding the rule of law and private property.","a completely free market, unsupervised by kings and priests, avaricious capitalists can establish monopolies or collude against their workforces.

Humankind really has taken over the world.","In 1700 the world was home to some 700 million humans. In 1800 there were 950 million of us. By 1900 we almost doubled our numbers to 1.6 billion. And by 2000 that quadrupled to 6 billion. Today there are just shy of 7 billion Sapiens.","Consumerism and nationalism work extra hours to make us imagine that millions of strangers belong to the same community as ourselves, that we all have a common past, common interests and a common future. This isn’t a lie. It’s imagination. Like money, limited liability companies and human rights, nations and consumer tribes are inter-subjective realities. They exist only in our collective imagination, yet their power is immense.","Most people don’t appreciate just how peaceful an era we live in. None of us was alive a thousand years ago, so we easily forget how much more violent the world used to be. And as wars become more rare they attract more attention.","In the year 2000, wars caused the deaths of 310,000 individuals, and violent crime killed another 520,000. Each and every victim is a world destroyed, a family ruined, friends and relatives scarred for life. Yet from a macro perspective these 830,000 victims comprised only 1.5 per cent of the 56 million people who died in 2000. That year 1.26 million people died in car accidents (2.25 per cent of total mortality) and 815,000 people committed suicide (1.45 per cent).4 The figures for 2002 are even more surprising. Out of 57 million dead, only 172,000 people died in war and 569,000 died of violent crime (a total of 741,000 victims of human violence). In contrast, 873,000 people committed suicide.","while the price of war soared, its profits declined. For most of history, polities could enrich themselves by looting or annexing enemy territories. Most wealth consisted of material things like fields, cattle, slaves and gold, so it was easy to loot it or occupy it. Today, wealth consists mainly of human capital and organisational know-how. Consequently it is difficult to carry it off or conquer it by military force.","if you’re a top executive earning $250,000 a year and you win $1 million on the lottery, or your company board suddenly decides to double your salary, your surge is likely to last only a few weeks. According to the empirical findings, it’s almost certainly not going to make a big difference to the way you feel over the long run. You’ll buy a snazzier car, move into a palatial home, get used to drinking Chateau Pétrus instead of California Cabernet, but it’ll soon all seem routine and unexceptional.","Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. People with strong families who live in tight-knit and supportive communities are significantly happier than people whose families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part of. Marriage is particularly important. Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being, and between bad marriages and misery.","Like all other mental states, our subjective well-being is not determined by external parameters such as salary, social relations or political rights. Rather, it is determined by a complex system of nerves, neurons, synapses and various biochemical substances such as serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin.","Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that evolution has moulded us to be neither too miserable nor too happy. It enables us to enjoy a momentary rush of pleasant sensations, but these never last for ever. Sooner or later they subside and give place to unpleasant sensations.","For example, evolution provided pleasant feelings as rewards to males who spread their genes by having sex with fertile females. If sex were not accompanied by such pleasure, few males would bother. At the same time, evolution made sure that these pleasant feelings quickly subsided. If orgasms were to last for ever, the very happy males would die of hunger for lack of interest in food, and would not take the trouble to look for additional fertile females.","mud huts, penthouses and the Champs-Elysées don’t really determine our mood. Serotonin does. When the medieval peasant completed the construction of his mud hut, his brain neurons secreted serotonin, bringing it up to level X.","Huxley’s disconcerting world is based on the biological assumption that happiness equals pleasure.","There is an important cognitive and ethical component to happiness. Our values make all the difference to whether we see ourselves as ‘miserable slaves to a baby dictator’ or as ‘lovingly nurturing a new life’.2 As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how.","Buddha agreed with modern biology and New Age movements that happiness is independent of external conditions. Yet his more important and far more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings. Indeed, the more significance we give our feelings, the more we crave them, and the more we suffer. Buddha’s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings."]},{"title":"Ikigai","author":"Héctor;Miralles García","highlights":["logotherapy, which helps people find their purpose in life.","Okinawans live by the principle of ichariba chode, a local expression that means “treat everyone like a brother, even if you’ve never met them before.”","According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming strong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family relations.","Ancient wisdom advises against eating until we are full.

The side of the equation we end up on depends on our decisions, not on the condition in which we find ourselves.","The woman shared her story in a group session. To help her, Frankl asked another woman to imagine a hypothetical situation in which she lay on her deathbed, old and wealthy but childless. The woman insisted that, in that case, she would have felt her life had been a failure. When the suicidal mother was asked to perform the same exercise, imagining herself on her deathbed, she looked back and realized that she had done everything in her power for her children—for both of them.","An elderly doctor, unable to overcome the deep depression into which he’d fallen after the death of his wife two years earlier, went to Frankl for help. Instead of giving him advice or analyzing his condition, Frankl asked him what would have happened if he had been the one who died first. The doctor, horrified, answered that it would have been terrible for his poor wife, that she would have suffered tremendously. To which Frankl responded, “You see, doctor? You have spared her all that suffering, but the price you have to pay for this is to survive, and mourn her.”","Morita therapy focuses on teaching patients to accept their emotions without trying to control them, since their feelings will change as a result of their actions.","1. Accept your feelings. If we have obsessive thoughts, we should not try to control them or get rid of them. If we do, they become more intense.","Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh, who would say, “Hello, solitude. How are you today? Come, sit with me, and I will care for you.”","Do what you should be doing. We shouldn’t focus on eliminating symptoms, because recovery will come on its own. We should focus instead on the present moment, and if we are suffering, on accepting that suffering. Above all, we should avoid intellectualizing the situation.","3. Discover your life’s purpose. We can’t control our emotions, but we can take charge of our actions every day.","2. Do what you should be doing. We shouldn’t focus on eliminating symptoms, because recovery will come on its own. We should focus instead on the present moment, and if we are suffering, on accepting that suffering. Above all, we should avoid intellectualizing the situation.","The four phases of Morita therapy Morita’s original treatment, which lasts fifteen to twenty-one days, consists of the following stages: 1. Isolation and rest (five to seven days). During the first week of treatment, the patient rests in a room without any external stimuli. No television, books, family, friends, or speaking. All the patient has is his thoughts. He lies down for most of the day and is visited regularly by the therapist, who tries to avoid interacting with him as much as possible. The therapist simply advises the patient to continue observing the rise and fall of his emotions as he lies there. When the patient gets bored and wants to start doing things again, he is ready to move on to the next stage of therapy. 2. Light occupational therapy (five to seven days). In this stage, the patient performs repetitive tasks in silence. One of these is keeping a diary about his thoughts and feelings. The patient goes outside after a week of being shut in, takes walks in nature, and does breathing exercises. He also starts doing simple activities, such as gardening, drawing, or painting. During this stage, the patient is still not allowed to talk to anyone, except the therapist. 3. Occupational therapy (five to seven days). In this stage, the patient performs tasks that require physical movement. Dr. Morita liked to take his patients to the mountains to chop wood. In addition to physical tasks, the patient is also immersed in other activities, such as writing, painting, or making ceramics. The patient can speak with others at this stage, but only about the tasks at hand. 4. The return to social life and the “real” world. The patient leaves the hospital and is reintroduced to social life, but maintains the practices of meditation and occupational therapy developed during treatment. The idea is to reenter society as a new person, with a sense of purpose, and without being controlled by social or emotional pressures.","Naikan meditation Morita was a great Zen master of Naikan introspective meditation. Much of his therapy draws on his knowledge and mastery of this school, which centers on three questions the individual must ask him- or herself: 1. What have I received from person X? 2. What have I given to person X? 3. What problems have I caused person X?","We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. —Aristotle","Imagine you are skiing down one of your favorite slopes. Powdery snow flies up on both sides of you like white sand. Conditions are perfect. You are entirely focused on skiing as well as you can. You know exactly how to move at each moment. There is no future, no past. There is only the present. You feel the snow, your skis, your body, and your consciousness united as a single entity. You are completely immersed in the experience, not thinking about or distracted by anything else. Your ego dissolves, and you become part of what you are doing.","As Csikszentmihalyi asserts in his book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, flow is “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”","If you’re a graphic designer, learn a new software program for your next project. If you’re a programmer, use a new programming language. If you’re a dancer, try to incorporate into your next routine a movement that has seemed impossible for years. Add a little something extra, something that takes you out of your comfort zone.","studies indicate that working on several things at once lowers our productivity by at least 60 percent and our IQ by more than ten points.","We’ve all been bored in a class or at a conference and started doodling to keep ourselves entertained. Or whistled while painting a wall. If we’re not truly being challenged, we get bored and add a layer of complexity to amuse ourselves. Our ability to turn routine tasks into moments of microflow, into something we enjoy, is key to our being happy, since we all have to do such tasks.","Happiness is in the doing, not in the result. As a rule of thumb, remind yourself: “Rituals over goals.” The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones who spend more time than others in a state of flow.","After reading this chapter you should have a better idea of which activities in your life make you enter flow. Write all of them on a piece of paper, then ask yourself these questions: What do the activities that drive you to flow have in common? Why do those activities drive you to flow? For example, are all the activities you most like doing ones that you practice alone or with other people? Do you flow more when doing things that require you to move your body or just to think?","Washington Burnap stated two hundred years ago: “The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.”2","Okinawa is the only province in Japan without trains. Its residents have to walk or cycle when not driving. It is also the only province that has managed to follow the Japanese government’s recommendation of eating less than ten grams of salt per day.","Locals eat a wide variety of foods, especially vegetables. Variety seems to be key. A study of Okinawa’s centenarians showed that they ate 206 different foods, including spices, on a regular basis. They ate an average of eighteen different foods each day, a striking contrast to the nutritional poverty of our fast-food culture.","They eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. At least seven types of fruits and vegetables are consumed by Okinawans on a daily basis.","A table featuring red peppers, carrots, spinach, cauliflower, and eggplant, for example, offers great color and variety. Vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and soy products such as tofu are the staples of an Okinawan’s diet. More than 30 percent of their daily calories comes from vegetables. ▪ Grains are the foundation of their diet. Japanese people eat white rice every day, sometimes adding noodles. Rice is the primary food in Okinawa, as well. ▪ They rarely eat sugar, and if they do, it’s cane sugar. We drove through several sugarcane fields every morning on our way to Ogimi, and even drank a glass of cane juice at Nakijin Castle. Beside the stall selling the juice was a sign describing the anticarcinogenic benefits of sugarcane.","Okinawans eat fish an average of three times per week; unlike in other parts of Japan, the most frequently consumed meat is pork, though locals eat it only once or twice per week.","Okinawans consume, in general, one-third as much sugar as the rest of Japan’s population, which means that sweets and chocolate are much less a part of their diet. ▪ They also eat practically half as much salt as the rest of Japan: 7 grams per day, compared to an average of 12. ▪ They consume fewer calories: an average of 1,785 per day, compared to 2,068 in the rest of Japan. In fact, low caloric intake is common among the five Blue Zones.","Serving food on many small plates makes it easier to avoid eating too much, and facilitates the varied diet discussed at the beginning of this chapter.","these fifteen foods are considered keys to Okinawan vitality: ▪ Tofu ▪ Miso ▪ Tuna ▪ Carrots ▪ Goya (bitter melon) ▪ Kombu (sea kelp) ▪ Cabbage ▪ Nori (seaweed) ▪ Onion ▪ Soy sprouts ▪ Hechima (cucumber-like gourd) ▪ Soybeans (boiled or raw) ▪ Sweet potato ▪ Peppers ▪ Sanpin-cha (jasmine tea)","Okinawans drink an average of three cups of Sanpin-cha every day.","we can drink jasmine tea, or even a high-quality green tea, instead.","Shikuwasa is the citrus fruit par excellence of Okinawa, and Ogimi is its largest producer in all of Japan. The fruit is extremely acidic: It is impossible to drink shikuwasa juice without diluting it first with water. Its taste is somewhere between that of a lime and a mandarin orange, to which it bears a family resemblance. Shikuwasas also contain high levels of nobiletin, a flavonoid rich in antioxidants.","Foods that should be eliminated are refined sugar and grains, processed baked goods, and prepared foods, along with cow’s milk and all its derivatives. Following this diet will help you feel younger and slow the process of premature aging.","“Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where it can get burned off, slow down. And after two hours, good cholesterol drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things going again. These things are so simple they’re almost stupid,”","The exercises take five or ten minutes, depending on whether you do all or only some of them. They focus on dynamic stretching and increasing joint mobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raising your arms above your head and then bringing them down in a circular motion.","Jnana yoga: the yoga of wisdom; the search for discipline and mental growth ▪ Karma yoga: focuses on action, on tasks and duties that benefit oneself and one’s community ▪ Bhakti yoga: the yoga of devotion and surrender to the divine ▪ Mantra yoga: focuses on the recitation of mantras to reach a state of relaxation ▪ Kundalini yoga: combines diverse steps to reach the desired mental state ▪ Raja yoga: also known as the royal path; encompasses a range of steps geared toward achieving communion with oneself and others ▪ Hatha yoga: the most widespread form in the West and Japan; characterized by asanas or poses combined in a quest for balance","Styles of tai chi There are different schools and styles of tai chi. The following are the best known: ▪ Chen-style: alternates between slow movements and explosive ones ▪ Yang-style: the most widespread of the forms; characterized by slow, fluid movements ▪ Wu-style: utilizes small, slow, deliberate movements ▪ Hao-style: centered on internal movements, with almost microscopic external movements; one of the least practiced forms of tai chi, even in China Despite their differences, these styles all have the same objectives: 1. To control movement through stillness 2. To overcome force through finesse 3. To move second and arrive first 4. To know yourself and your opponent","According to the master Yang Chengfu, the correct practice of tai chi follows ten basic principles: 1. Elevate the crown of your head, and focus all your energy there. 2. Tighten your chest and expand your back to lighten your lower body. 3. Relax your waist and let it guide your body. 4. Learn to differentiate between heaviness and lightness, knowing how your weight is distributed. 5. Relax the shoulders to allow free movement of the arms and promote the flow of energy. 6. Value the agility of the mind over the strength of the body. 7. Unify the upper and lower body so they act in concert. 8. Unify the internal and the external to synchronize mind, body, and breath. 9. Do not break the flow of your movement; maintain fluidity and harmony. 10. Look for stillness in movement. An active body leads to a calm mind.","One of the best-known movements in tai chi consists of following the form of clouds in an exercise called Wave Hands Like Clouds.","Sun Simiao was a proponent of a technique called the Six Healing Sounds, which involves the coordination of movement, breathing, and pronouncing sounds with the purpose of bringing our souls to a place of calm. The six sounds are: Xu, pronounced like “shh” with a deep sigh, which is associated with the liver He, pronounced like “her” with a yawn, which is associated with the heart Si, pronounced like “sir” with a slow exhale, which is associated with the lungs Chui, pronounced like “chwee” with a forceful exhale, which is associated with the kidneys Hoo, pronounced like “who,” which is associated with the spleen Xi, pronounced like “she, ” which connects the whole body","resilience? One thing that everyone with a clearly defined ikigai has in common is that they pursue their passion no matter what. They never give up, even when the cards seem stacked against them or they face one hurdle after another. We’re talking about resilience, a concept that has become influential among psychologists. But resilience isn’t just the ability to persevere. As we’ll see in this chapter, it is also an outlook we can cultivate to stay focused on the important things in life rather than what is most urgent, and to keep ourselves from being carried away by negative emotions. In the final section of the chapter, we’ll explore techniques that go beyond resilience to cultivate antifragility. Sooner or later, we all have to face difficult moments, and the way we do this can make a huge difference to our quality of life. Proper training for our mind, body, and emotional resilience is essential for confronting life’s ups and downs. Nana","In the words of the famous Serenity Prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr: God, give us grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, Courage to change the things which should be changed, and the Wisdom to distinguish the one from the other.","In order to keep their minds virtuous, the Stoics practiced something like negative visualization: They imagined the worst thing that could happen in order to be prepared if certain privileges and pleasures were taken from them. To practice negative visualization, we have to reflect on negative events, but without worrying about them.","Worrying about things that are beyond our control accomplishes nothing. We should have a clear sense of what we can change and what we can’t, which in turn will allow us to resist giving in to negative emotions.","One of the most commonly used mantras in Buddhism focuses on controlling negative emotions: “Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ,” in which oṃ is the generosity that purifies the ego, ma is the ethics that purifies jealousy, ṇi is the patience that purifies passion and desire, pad is the precision that purifies bias, me is the surrender that purifies greed, and hūṃ is the wisdom that purifies hatred.","Both Buddhism and Stoicism remind us that the present is all that exists, and it is the only thing we can control.
