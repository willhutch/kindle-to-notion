List all the ways you think the other person did you wrong. Forgiving another person honestly and specifically goes a long way toward healing the relationship. Start each item with “I forgive you for…” Keep going until you get everything out. We’re not sending this letter, so you can repeat yourself if the same thing keeps coming to mind. Write everything you wanted to say but never had a chance. You don’t have to feel forgiveness. Yet. When you write it down, what you’re doing is beginning to understand the pain more specifically so that you can slowly let it go. Acknowledge your own shortcomings. What was your role, if any, in the situation or conflict? List the ways you feel you did wrong, starting each with the phrase “Please forgive me for …” Remember you can’t undo the past, but taking responsibility for your role will help you understand and let go of your anger toward yourself and the other person. When you are done with this letter, record yourself reading it. (Most phones can do this.) Play it back, putting yourself in the position of the objective observer. Remember that the pain inflicted on you isn’t yours. It’s the other person’s pain. When you squeeze an orange, you get orange juice. When you squeeze someone full of pain, pain comes out. Instead of absorbing it or giving it back, if you forgive, you help diffuse the pain.

Complainers, like the friend on the phone, who complain endlessly without looking for solutions. Life is a problem that will be hard if not impossible to solve. Cancellers, who take a compliment and spin it: “You look good today” becomes “You mean I looked bad yesterday?” Casualties, who think the world is against them and blame their problems on others. Critics, who judge others for either having a different opinion or not having one, for any choices they’ve made that are different from what the critic would have done. Commanders, who realize their own limits but pressure others to succeed. They’ll say, “You never have time for me,” even though they’re busy as well. Competitors, who compare themselves to others, controlling and manipulating to make themselves or their choices look better. They are in so much pain that they want to bring others down. Often we have to play down our successes around these people because we know they can’t appreciate them. Controllers, who monitor and try to direct how their friends or partners spend time, and with whom, and what choices they make.

What would my teachers think? I invite myself to go even deeper. What am I really scared of? I see this fear around my parents—of them not getting along and of me, at a young age, trying to mediate their marriage. Of thinking, How can I please both of them? How can I manage them and make sure they’re happy? That’s when I find the root of my fear.

the fear always led me to the same concern: how I was perceived by others. What would they think of me? My root fear influences my decision-making.

TRY THIS: AUDIT YOUR ATTACHMENTS Ask yourself: “What am I afraid of losing?” Start with the externals: Is it your car, your house, your looks? Write down everything you think of. Now think about the internals: your reputation, your status, your sense of belonging? Write those down too. These combined lists are likely to be the greatest sources of pain in your life—your fear of having these things taken away. Now start thinking about changing your mental relationship with those things so that you are less attached to them. Remember—you can still fully love and enjoy your partner, your children, your home, your money, from a space of nonattachment. It’s about understanding and accepting that all things are temporary and that we can’t truly own or control anything, so that we can fully appreciate these things and they can enhance our life rather than be a source of griping and fear. What better way to accept that children eventually go off to live their own lives and call you once a week, if you’re lucky?

Perhaps it was months and months of trying unsuccessfully to conceive or being rejected from three other jobs you’d applied for.

Imagine the sunlight coming through the windows. You get up, and as your feet touch the ground, you feel a sense of gratitude for another day. Really feel that gratitude, and then say in your mind, “I am grateful for today. I am excited for today. I am joyful for today.”

The two things to remember are the bad we’ve done to others and the good others have done for us. By focusing on the bad we’ve done to others, our egos are forced to remember our imperfections and regrets. This keeps us grounded. When we remember the good others have done for us, we feel humbled by our need for others and our gratitude for the gifts we have received. The two things that we were told to forget are the good we’ve done for others and the bad others have done to us. If we fixate on and are impressed by our own good deeds, our egos grow, so we put those deeds aside. And if others treat us badly, we have to let that go too. This doesn’t mean we have to be best friends with someone hurtful, but harboring anger and grudges keeps us focused on ourselves instead of taking a broader perspective.

Receiving an insult. Observe your ego, take a broader view of the person’s negativity, and respond to the situation, not the insult. Receiving a compliment or accolades. Take this opportunity to be grateful for the teacher who helped you further this quality. Arguing with a partner. The desire to be right, to win, comes from your ego’s unwillingness to admit weakness. Remember you can be right, or you can move forward. See the other person’s side. Lose the battle. Wait a day and see how it feels. Topping people. When we listen to others, we often one-up them with a story that shows how we have it better or worse. Instead, listen to understand and acknowledge. Be curious. Don’t say anything about yourself.

Bring your awareness to your natural breathing pattern. Breathe in and out. Bring your awareness to your body. Become aware of where it touches the ground, a seat, and where it does not. You may find that your heels touch the ground but your arches don’t. Or your lower back touches the bed or mat but your middle back is slightly raised. Become aware of all these subtle connections. Now begin to scan your body. Bring your awareness to your feet. Scan your toes, your arches, your ankles, your heels. Become aware of the different sensations you may feel. You may feel relaxed, or you may feel pain, pressure, tingling, or something totally different. Become aware of it and then visualize that you are breathing in positive, uplifting, healing energy and breathing out any negative toxic energy. Now move upward to your legs, calves, shins, and knees. Again, just scan and observe the sensations. Whenever your mind wanders, gently and softly bring it back to your body. No force or pressure. No judgment. At some point you may come across pain you were not aware of before. Be present with that pain. Observe it. And again breathe into it three times and breathe out three times. You can also express gratitude for different parts of your body as you scan them. Do this all the way to the tip of your head. You can move as slowly or as quickly as you like, but don’t rush.

When the monkey mind, which amplifies negativity, tries to convince us that we’re useless and worthless, the more reasonable monk mind counters by pointing out that others have given us their time, energy, and love. They have made efforts on our behalf. Gratitude for their kindness is entwined with self-esteem, because if we are worthless, then that would make their generosity toward us worthless too.

Re-experience it with awe, and experience those feelings in a deeper way. After this visualization, recognize that small things are happening for you. Don’t overlook them or take them for granted. Next, take a moment to feel a sense of being cared for, thought of, loved. This should boost your selfesteem and self-confidence. Last, know that just feeling great is not the end goal.

Think of five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Absorb the love, joy, and happiness. Take the love from that moment and visualize it flowing through your entire body. From your feet, to your legs, to your hips, to your stomach, to your chest, arms, back, neck, and head. Give love, joy, and gratitude to each part of your body. Do this for five minutes. Ask yourself, “What is my intention for today?” Is it to be kind, to be confident, to be focused? Set that intention now. Repeat the following to yourself 3 times each: “I am happy about who I am becoming. I am open to all opportunities and possibilities. I am worthy of real love.

TRY THIS: TWO DEATH MEDITATIONS To imagine your own death gives you a bird’s-eye view of your life. Try a death meditation whenever you are questioning whether or not to do something—to make a significant change, learn a new skill, take a trip. I recommend that you always do a death meditation at the beginning of a new year, to inspire new paths in the upcoming year. Visualizing the inevitable will give you every lesson you need to live a fulfilling life. Fast-forward to yourself at age eighty or ninety, however long you want to live, and imagine yourself on your deathbed. Ask your future self questions such as:            What do I wish I’d done?            What experiences do I wish I’d had?            What do I regret not giving more attention?            What skills do I wish I’d worked on?            What do I wish I’d detached from? Use these answers to motivate yourself—instead of having regrets on your deathbed, put those wishes into action today. Imagine how you’d like to be remembered at your own funeral. Don’t focus on what people thought of you, who loved you, and how sad they will be to lose you. Instead think about the impact you’ve had. Then imagine how you would be remembered if you died today. What’s the gap between these two images? This too should galvanize you to build your legacy.

ACCEPTANCE IMAGERY This is a variation on the four-step expansion technique. It is often helpful for people who are good at visualizing. First scan your body and pick the sensation that bothers you the most. Observe it the way a curious scientist might. Now visualize that sensation as an object. What is the size and shape of it? Is it liquid, solid, or gaseous? Is it transparent or opaque? What color is it? Does the color vary? What is its temperature? Is it light, heavy, or weightless? How does the surface feel to the touch: rough, smooth, wet, dry, sticky, spiky, hot, cold? Is there any sound associated with it? Is there any vibration, pulsation, or movement within it? Is its position fixed or shifting? Take a few slow, deep breaths. Breathe into and around this object. Create space for it. Open up around it and allow it to be there, to stay right where it is. You don’t have to like it; just let it be. Don’t try to get rid of the object and don’t try to alter it. If it changes by itself, that’s okay. If it doesn’t change, that’s okay, too. The aim is simply to accept it.

Q: Why not? A: Because continually trying to maintain that high self-esteem can actually pull you away from what you value. Remember Michelle, working late at the office to improve her sense of worthiness, but missing out on spending time with her family? High self-esteem may give you some pleasant feelings in the short term, but in the long run, trying to maintain it will probably exhaust you. Because of the way the human mind has evolved, the “not good enough” story will always return in one form or another. Do you want to spend the rest of your life battling it? Why bother when you can have a fulfilling life without exerting all that effort?

One group that particularly suffers is those for whom high self-esteem is largely dependent upon excelling at work. When they perform well, they feel great, but as soon as their performance drops (as it always will, sooner or later), their self-esteem comes crashing down. This leads them into a vicious cycle, putting increasing pressure on themselves to perform ever better, which leads to high stress, fatigue, and burnout. However, the good news is, leading a rich, full, and meaningful life doesn’t depend on self-esteem in the slightest.

Customer Obsession. Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers. 2. Ownership. Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say, “that’s not my job.” 3. Invent and Simplify. Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time. 4. Are Right, A Lot. Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs. 5. Learn and Be Curious. Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them. 6. Hire and Develop the Best. Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice. 7. Insist on the Highest Standards. Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed. 8. Think Big. Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers. 9. Bias for Action. Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking. 10. Frugality. Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense. 11. Earn Trust. Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best. 12. Dive Deep. Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them. 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit. Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly. 14. Deliver Results. Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

The wrong kind of compensation practice can cause misalignment in two ways: (1) by rewarding short-term goals at the expense of long-term value creation, and (2) by rewarding the achievement of localized departmental milestones whether or not they benefit the company as a whole. Both can powerfully drive behaviors that are antithetical to the company’s ultimate goals.

Many companies set entirely independent goals for key players at every level. All too often this gives rise to infighting, information withholding, and hoarding of resources, as each leader is incentivized to undermine the other. Amazon’s compensation is, by contrast, simple and oriented toward the long term. As one is promoted at Amazon, the ratio of cash to equity compensation becomes more and more skewed toward long-term equity.

Working as Jeff’s shadow was a bit like drinking from a fire hose. One surprising challenge of the job I (Colin) noticed early on was just how much context switching went on each day. Every week Jeff—and therefore I—had three recurring meetings: the four-hour S-Team meeting discussed in the previous chapter, a Weekly Business Review (chapter six), and an informal Monday-morning S-Team breakfast near the office. In addition to those, on any given day we’d usually meet with two to four product teams, where we’d spend between one and two hours doing a deep dive on new products and features. Throw in the occasional retail, finance, and operations updates, plus a fire drill or two requiring immediate attention, and you have a typical week.

Suppose Sony decides to introduce a new TV. The sales and marketing group has done its research into customer preferences and market trends (but not necessarily the customer experience) and has determined that Sony should offer a 44-inch TV at a price point of $1,999. The engineering team, however, has been working on the new TV for quite some time, and their focus has been on picture quality, which means higher resolution, and they have not been especially concerned about price point. The TV they come up with will cost $2,000 just to manufacture. So there is no way that the retail price can be $1,999. If the two organizations had started the process by writing a press release, they would have had to agree on the features, cost, customer experience, and price. Then they could have worked backwards to figure out what to build, thereby surfacing the challenges they would face in product development and manufacturing.

A common question asked by executives when reviewing the product features in the PR is “so what?” If the press release doesn’t describe a product that is meaningfully better (faster, easier, cheaper) than what is already out there, or results in some stepwise change in customer experience, then it isn’t worth building.

When the retail, operations, and finance teams began to construct the initial Amazon WBR, they turned to a well-known Six Sigma process improvement method called DMAIC, an acronym for Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control.1 Should you decide to implement a Weekly Business Review for your business, we recommend following the DMAIC steps as well. The order of the steps matters. Progressing through this metrics life cycle in this order can prevent a lot of frustration and rework, allowing you to achieve your goals faster.

continual improvement is the operating philosophy.2 Amazon takes this philosophy to heart, focusing most of its effort on leading indicators (we call these “controllable input metrics”) rather than lagging indicators (“output metrics”). Input metrics track things like selection, price, or convenience—factors that Amazon can control through actions such as adding items to the catalog, lowering cost so prices can be lowered, or positioning inventory to facilitate faster delivery to customers. Output metrics—things like orders, revenue, and profit—are important, but they generally can’t be directly manipulated in a sustainable manner over the long term. Input metrics measure things that, done right, bring about the desired results in your output metrics.

Since it’s a cycle, you can start at any input. The metrics for Customer Experience, for example, could include speed of shipping, breadth of selection, richness of product information, ease of use, and so forth. Watch what happens when we improve customer experience: Better customer experience leads to more traffic. More traffic attracts more sellers seeking those buyers. More sellers lead to wider selection. Wider selection enhances customer experience, completing the circle. The cycle drives growth, which in turn lowers cost structure. Lower costs lead to lower prices, improving customer experience, and the flywheel

The Amazon flywheel captures the major aspect of what makes Amazon’s retail business successful. Therefore, it should be no surprise that almost all the metrics discussed in the WBR can be categorized into one of the flywheel elements. In fact, the first page of the WBR deck has a picture of the very same flywheel above.

One of the metrics we initially chose for selection was the number of new detail pages created, on the assumption that more pages meant better selection. Once we identified this metric, it had an immediate effect on the actions of the retail teams. They became excessively focused on adding new detail pages—each team added tens, hundreds, even thousands of items to their categories that had not previously been available on Amazon.

That is, if product A has sold 30 units in the past month and product B has sold 10 units in the past month, and they are both out of stock at the time the in-stock measurement is recorded, product A will impact the in-stock metric three times more than product B will. We add software to the product pages that performs the following actions. Every time a product page is displayed, we add one to the metric “Total Number of Product Pages Displayed.” If that product is in stock when it is displayed, we add one to the metric “Total Number of In-Stock Product Pages Displayed.” At the end of the day, we divide the “Total Number of In-Stock Product Pages Displayed” by the “Total Number of Product Pages Displayed,” to get our overall in-stock metric for the day. For example, suppose you displayed one million detail pages total across every product in your catalog, and 850,000 of those product pages displayed a product that was in stock. Then your demand-weighted instock percentage for that day would be 85 percent. Products that customers view more have a greater impact on this metric than products that are viewed rarely. Each of these metrics measures in-stock in a different way and can yield quite a different result for the same business on the same day. The first metric may skew the data depending on the time of day the company receives the bulk of its inventory. If most of the inventory comes in at night, the item could have been out of stock for most of the day but replenished just before the in-stock data is collected. The result will be that the in-stock performance will look better to the company than what the bulk of the customers actually experienced that day. And if a popular item is out of stock for a long period of time, it will have less of an impact on the metric each day since the metric is weighted by trailing 30-day sales of that item. The second metric, while more expensive to collect (at least in the short run), is a more accurate representation of what customers experienced that day. It captures, from a customer point of view, what percent of the time they experienced that Amazon was in-stock on the item(s) they viewed. The first metric is inward-facing and operations-centric, while the second metric is out-ward-facing and customer-centric. Start with the customer and work backwards by aligning your metrics with the customer experience.

COVID-19 by region. It is not enough to look at the number of positive tests in your region as compared to another region with a population of a similar size. You must also look at the number of tests per capita performed in each region. Since both the number of positive tests and the number of tests per capita in each location will keep changing, you will need to keep updating your audit of the measurements.*

We use consistent and familiar formatting to speed interpretation A good deck uses a consistent format throughout—the graph design, time periods covered, color palette, symbol set (for current year/prior year/goal), and the same number of charts on every page wherever possible. Some data naturally lend themselves to different presentations, but the default is to display in the standard format. Amazon thereby looks at the same set of data every week, in the same order, and gets a holistic view of the business. The team builds up expertise in spotting trends and picks up the rhythm of the review; anomalies stand out more distinctly, and the meeting runs more efficiently.

With a sizable existing business, if you only pay attention to the output metric “revenue,” you typically won’t see the effects of new customer deceleration for quite some time. However, if you look at input metrics instead—things like “new customers,” “new customer revenue,” and “existing customer revenue”—you will detect the signal much earlier, and with a much clearer call to action.

Amazon employs many techniques to ensure that anecdotes reach the teams that own and operate a service. One example is a program called the Voice of the Customer. The customer service department routinely collects and summarizes customer feedback and presents it during the WBR, though not necessarily every week. The chosen feedback does not always reflect the most commonly received complaint, and the CS department has wide latitude on what to present. When the stories are read at the WBR, they are often painful to hear because they highlight just how much we let customers down.

Exception reports come in many flavors, but the following Contribution Profit (CP) example should illustrate the basic concept and its usefulness. CP is defined as the incremental money generated after selling an item and deducting the variable costs associated with that item. It’s essentially the money the company has left over after the sale of the item, which goes to pay for the fixed costs of the business and, ideally after that, contributes a profit. There is a CP Exception report that lists the top ten CP negative products (ones that did not generate a profit) within a category for the previous week.

As we considered the problem of the damaged lawn furniture before the next call arrived, Jeff blurted out, “We need an Andon Cord for customer service.” There was no assembly line to halt, but the CS agent would be given the authority to click on what we called “the big red button” on their control screen. Once that button was clicked, two things happened: the “Add to Cart” and “1-Click” buttons would disappear from the product page so no customers could buy that product, and the category manager would immediately be notified that purchasing for one of their products had been disabled until they could investigate and fix the issue.

MENTAL BLOCK #1: “FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER” It’s wrong to believe there is only one right answer to any question. There are always other solutions. If we believe they are there and we’re willing to look for them, we will find them. MENTAL BLOCK #2: “THAT’S NOT LOGICAL” Albert Einstein said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.”2 Imagination turns possibilities into reality. It’s willing to take leaps that logic can’t. While logic does have great value and you should keep it, you should intentionally add creativity. MENTAL BLOCK #3: “FOLLOW THE RULES” I’ve always loved this quote from Thomas Edison: “There ain’t no rules around here! We are tryin’ to accomplish some[thing]!”3 Most revolutionary ideas have been disruptive violations of set rules. MENTAL BLOCK #4: “AVOID AMBIGUITY” Life is complex. It’s messy. It’s contradictory and paradoxical. Why in the world would we think we should—or could—avoid ambiguity? There is never one fixed way to understand something—everything can be understood in more than one way. MENTAL BLOCK #5: “FAILURE IS BAD” Creative people don’t avoid failure. They see it as a friend. They know that if they are to experiment, innovate, and create, they will fail. They embrace risk. MENTAL BLOCK #6: “DON’T BE FOOLISH” To stand up is to stand out. You have to stick your neck out to put your head above the crowd. If others don’t at first understand or accept you, so what? All the great dreamers looked foolish to someone. How you are perceived by others is less important than how effective you can be. MENTAL BLOCK #7: “I’M NOT CREATIVE” The mental block that most keeps us from being creative is believing we don’t possess creativity. This self-perception is a barrier to talent, opportunity, and intelligence. But the truth is that everyone can learn to be creative. The only real block to creativity is our disbelief. I love what blogger Hugh MacLeod said about this: “Everyone is born creative; everyone is given a box of crayons in kindergarten. Then when you hit puberty they take the crayons away and replace them with dry, uninspiring books on algebra, history, etc. Being suddenly hit years later with the ‘creative bug’ is just a wee voice telling you, ‘I’d like my crayons back, please.’”4

From about the age of forty, I have greatly valued the help of my inner circle, the people closest to me in life and in business. These individuals compensate for my weaknesses, focus on today, and implement much of the work in my organizations. Most of these people have worked with me for many years, some for more than two decades. But over the last few years, I have intentionally cultivated another group that I call my outer circle. These people have fresh eyes and can speak to me from a different perspective. They enhance my strengths, help me focus on tomorrow, and give me creative ideas. The people in this group change frequently, based on time and opportunities. Together, both circles complement or empower each other and complete me.

No one in a corporation deliberately sets out to stifle creative thought. Yet, a traditional bureaucratic structure, with its need for predictability, linear logic, conformance to accepted norms, and the dictates of the most recent “long-range” vision statement, is a nearly perfect idea-killing machine. People in groups regress toward the security of the familiar and the well-regulated. Even creative people do it. It’s easier.

NATURAL AUTHORITY: Some people naturally lead better than others and therefore step into leadership roles.         •     POSITIONAL AUTHORITY: This kind of authority comes with a title or a formal position in an organization and is the lowest level of leadership.         •     KNOWLEDGE AUTHORITY: Knowing more than others do or having specific information can give people an influence edge.         •     SITUATIONAL AUTHORITY: A certain circumstance can arise that requires the most qualified person to lead in that situation.         •     RELATIONAL AUTHORITY: When people have built relationships with others, that gives them influence to lead.         •     PROXIMITY AUTHORITY: When individuals are close to the real leader or authority figure, they can borrow from that leader’s influence to lead others.         •     SUCCESS AUTHORITY: Success gives people credibility, and others want to be on their team to be part of their success.         •     MENTORING AUTHORITY: Developers of other people increase their influence with the people they mentor and gain a reputation for credibility.         •     SENIORITY AUTHORITY: In some cultures, being an elder or having seniority in an organization gives authority.

Level 1: Position—People Follow Because They Have To The authority someone receives at this level is very limited and is restricted to the leader’s job description. A leader need not be competent to receive a leadership appointment. In some organizations, that person doesn’t even have to be competent to retain a leadership position. Level 2: Permission—People Follow Because They Want To A leader begins to develop authority at this second level. When the leader builds relationships, people are willing to work with them because they like them and enjoy spending time with them. They are beginning to give permission for the person to lead them. Level 3: Production—People Follow Because You Demonstrate Competence On this third level a leader begins to demonstrate genuine competence. Being productive is a big step in gaining moral authority with others. People follow because the leader has produced results and is successful, and they want to be on a winning team. Level 4: People Development—People Follow Because You Help Them Become Competent When you start to invest in people and help them to become successful personally, your level of authority rises dramatically, the lives of the people you help improve, and this gives you a level of credibility you can gain no other way. Level 5: Pinnacle—People Follow Because You Have a Reputation for Excellence When you live a life of competence, influence people at each of the first four levels, and develop leaders over a long period of time, you can approach the pinnacle of leadership. This is where true moral authority is established.

We all know plenty of people who have those qualities but who exercise no influence over us whatsoever. Why? Because there is a contradiction between what they claim to be and what we perceive them to be.11 What Stanley described is internal consistency between values and actions, which is essential to a leader’s success if he or she desires to gain moral authority. Equally important is the ability to be consistent over time.

CONSISTENCY ESTABLISHES YOUR REPUTATION. Nearly anyone can be good once. Being good continually is difficult. However, continued repetition leads to a positive reputation.         •     CONSISTENCY MAKES TEAM MEMBERS MORE SECURE. Perhaps the greatest compliment a person can receive is, “I can depend on you.” A consistent leader inspires team members to become more confident.         •     CONSISTENCY ALLOWS FOR ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF YOUR GROWTH. It’s difficult to gauge the progress of inconsistent people. The track record we establish shows what we have done and how far we have come.         •     CONSISTENCY MAKES YOU RELEVANT. People who bounce back and forth between engagement and disengagement always have to play catch-up. By staying consistently engaged, you don’t fall behind.         •     CONSISTENCY MODELS YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR OTHERS. When you consistently model your values and work ethic, team members know what you expect of them because they’ve seen it every day. Consistency always reinforces expectations.         •     CONSISTENCY MAINTAINS YOUR MESSAGE. When a leader communicates a vision but acts in ways that are inconsistent with that vision the result is confusion. It distracts from the message and makes it more difficult for everyone on the team.

The Happiness Trap: Stop Struggling, Start Living (Harris, Russ)
- Your Highlight on page 160 | location 2754-2760 | Added on Tuesday, 1 June 2021 17:59:14

The observing self can’t be judged as good or bad, right or wrong, because all it does is observe. If you do “the wrong thing” or a “bad thing,” the observing self is not in any way responsible; it merely notices what you’ve done and helps make you aware of it (thereby enabling you to learn from it). Moreover, the observing self will never judge you because judgments are thoughts and the observing self cannot think. It notices thoughts, but it cannot generate them. The observing self sees things as they are, without judging, criticizing, or doing any of the other thinking processes that set us up for a struggle with reality. Therefore, it gives acceptance in its truest, purest form.

Is each one a separate and distinct issue? If so, then your issue list is mutually exclusive. Does every aspect of the problem come under one (and only one) of these issues—that is, have you thought of everything? If so, then your issues are collectively exhaustive.

“Mr. Jones, I can treat your headache, but I think it’s a symptom of something more serious and I’d like to do further tests.” In the same way, you should go back to your client, or your boss—whoever it was that asked for your input in the first place—and say, “You asked me to look at problem X, but the real impact on our performance will come from solving problem Y. Now I can solve problem X, if that’s what you really want, but I think it’s in our interest to focus on Y.” If you have the data to back you up, the client can either accept your recommendation or tell you to stay on the original problem, but you will have fulfilled your responsibility to act in the client’s best interests.

We made frequent use of an analytical framework called Forces at Work. It proved especially valuable at the start of an engagement in helping us look at the likely external pressures on the client. The technique involves identifying the client’s suppliers, customers, competitors, and possible substitute products. We then list all the changes occurring in each of the four categories. What impact—positive or negative—could these have on our client? Also, what internal changes are affecting the client and the client’s industry? Which of these factors could actually cause major changes to the way the client designs, manufactures, distributes, sells, and services its products?

When generating an initial hypothesis, you don’t need all the facts, just enough to have a good overview of the industry and the problem. If the problem is in your own business, you may already have the facts in your head. That’s great, but facts are not enough. You have to apply structure to them. To structure your IH begin by breaking the problem into its components—the key drivers (see “Find the Key Drivers,” in Chapter 3). Next, make an actionable recommendation regarding each driver.

For your next step, you must take each top-line recommendation and break it down to the level of issues. If a given recommendation is correct, what issues does it raise? Consider the likely answers to each issue. Then go down another level. For each issue, what analyses would you need to make to prove or disprove your hypothesis? With a little experience, and a lot of debate within your team, you should get a good sense of what is provable and what is not. This will help you avoid blind alleys.

When deciding on which questions to ask, you might want to include some to which you know the answer. This may sound counterintuitive, but it’s really very useful. On questions of fact, asking a “ringer” will give you some insights into the interviewee’s honesty and/or knowledge. For complex issues, you may think you “know” the answer, but there may be more than one; you should find out as many as possible. Once you’ve written your guide, look at it and ask yourself, “What are the three things I most want to know by the end of the interview?” These are the things you will focus on when you go into the interviewee’s office, the three things that you will try your hardest to obtain before you leave.

Productive … is knowing you’re making excellent choices from a place of preparedness. Momentum … is a flow of great work that is so exciting it leads to more great work. It does the opposite of procrastination and stress. Control … gives you the power and confidence to keep on going, which creates even greater momentum, greater playfulness and greater productivity.

just use the SEE method. Information always enters our brains via our (s)enses. So, for example, when you’re trying to remember the word “horse,” it’s important to imagine its skin, smell, touch and even its taste. That way, you’ve created a multisensory image that’s far easier to recall than five letters. Up next is (e)xaggeration. Compared to an ordinary horse, you’re more likely to remember a giant bright pink horse wearing a tux, right? Forget logic, it’s all about making funny, fantastical images. And lastly, (e)nergize. A horse galloping at full speed into the sunset is far more entertaining than one standing still in a stable.

First, you’ll need to learn a system that changes numbers into letters or alters how those letters sound. Take the number zero, which can be represented by the letters s, z and c. Tough to remember? Think about a hissing wheel. After all, zero looks like a wheel anyway! Each number from zero to nine can be assigned a group of similar sounding consonants. For instance, the number six can be represented by the sounds j, sh/ch or a soft g. You can also use the shape of the numbers when you assign the sounds to make them easier to remember. For instance, if you flip the numbers two and three on the side they look like the letters N and M respectively and if you flip the number 9 horizontally or vertically, it looks like a p or a b. Vowels are left out for now, but come into use later. The next step in remembering a date or number is to write down the letters that represent them and make up a word. Say you want to remember the year 1969, when humans first walked on the moon. Most memorable dates happened in the last millennia, so you only need to remember the 969 bit. Therefore, the sounds b, sh and p should come to mind. Together, they can be used to make the word BiSHoP. The last stage is to make a picture for you to remember. Using the SEE principle, take the word you’ve created and your chosen date or number. For the above, a bishop dancing on the moon with Neil Armstrong should do the trick!

What goes in the @Action folder? Any email that you’ve received where you know a reply or other email action is needed and where the action will take longer than two minutes. What doesn’t belong in the @Action folder? Any emails where the response is a non-email related action (for example, where the email you’ve received prompts your decision to call someone, look into something, bring up something at a meeting, or generally deal with it in a way where the reminder is better stored on some kind of to-do list rather than in your inbox). We’ll talk about the idea of keeping such items on a Master Actions List, part of your new ‘second brain’, in the next few chapters! Any emails that can be replied to or dealt with in less than two minutes – just do those straight away, rather than clogging up your action folder with them! Any emails where you ‘think there’s probably something to do’ but haven’t decided what the action is – don’t be lazy in your thinking. Put it back in the inbox and work out the next step before you continue!

What goes in the @Read folder? Anything that you want to scan your eyeballs over at a later stage rather than read as soon as it lands in your inbox. What doesn’t belong in the @Read folder? Anything where you know there’s an action to perform. Make the distinction that the @Action folder is where you keep anything that needs an action, no matter how long those emails are! Anything that can be read and then either deleted or filed in less than two minutes (just do those as you go!). Any emails you don’t know whether you need to read or not – don’t move things there until you have made a definite decision of commitment. And be ruthless. Time spent reading someone else’s report is time not spent on creating impact and value. So be careful where you plan to put your attention. The @Read folder gives you the opportunity to save up big piles of reading for quieter periods and periods of inactive attention. Returning once a week to the @Read folder will have you speed reading ruthlessly through things that could easily have proved major distractions when you really needed to focus on other things. So using the @Read folder as a reminder to stay ruthless and focused is a huge Ninja advantage.

Organize … a lack of clarity about how long things might take, which tasks are the highest priority and an unrealistic impression of what’s really on our plate.

To remember his name, you might picture a fight between a HORSe and Bruce LEE. Once you’ve sorted your image, connect it to the person’s face whose name you’re trying to remember. That way, seeing their face will immediately bring up their name.

A great way to match a face to a name is to use the connection method. If the person has a striking feature, connect that to the name you’re trying to remember. If your colleague Janice has icy blue eyes, imagine icicles flying out of them! But what happens if you already know someone with that name? This is where the comparison method comes in. The key to this technique is to compare the new face to the one you know. Take two people with the name John. You could imagine both of their heads on one body, chatting to each other about how they look that day. Whichever method you use, make sure you revisit the names you’ve learned so that you use them continuously. It would also be handy to list the names in your diary or add the people whose names you’re trying to remember on your favorite social media channel.

Denniston hired demographers to crack German codes. The team noticed that each encryption began with three letters that weren’t part of the message. These letters revealed the cipher settings on the German encryption machine. After considering where a signal operator’s mind might go in a moment of extreme pressure, the team realized that the letters were taken from either the beginning of a German girl’s name – probably a girlfriend – or a swear word. Without a diverse team that possessed group wisdom, this important detail may have been overlooked.

It is important to understand that a fixed mindset is not easy to kick.

It comforts us time and again, so getting rid of it can be extremely discomforting.

The one critical thing you need throughout your pitch is the attention of your target. To successfully attain this, research has shown that you must evoke two sensations in your pitch: desire and tension. Desire arises when you offer your target a reward, and tension arises when you show them they might lose something, like an opportunity, as a result of this social encounter. On a neurological level, this effectively floods your target’s brain with two neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine.

Dopamine is a chemical associated with anticipating rewards — desire. One such reward would be the pleasure of understanding something new, such as solving a puzzle. Thus, to increase the level of dopamine in your target’s brain, you must introduce novelty through a pleasant surprise, like an unexpected yet entertaining product demo.

Norepinephrine, on the other hand, is the chemical responsible for alertness and it creates tension in the target. If your pitch convinces them that there is a lot at stake here, their brains will be flooded with norepinephrine. To create tension, you must create a bit of low level conflict with a push-pull strategy. This means first saying something to push the target away, like, “Maybe we aren’t a good match for each other.” You then counter this by pulling the target back toward you with something like, “But if we are, that would be terrific.”

Typically, your target will use the power frame which exudes arrogance. You must not do anything that validates the other person’s power. Instead, use small acts of defiance and denial to bust the frame; for example, by yanking your presentation material away from the target if they do not seem to be taking it seriously. Another oft-used frame is the time frame, where your customer asserts control over time: “I only have ten more minutes.” This is meant to push you off balance, but you can always counter with: “That’s fine, I only have five.” A particularly lethal frame is the analyst frame, denoted by a fixation on details and numbers. If your opponent is in this frame, they will likely insist on drilling down into minor technical and financial details, effectively bogging down your pitch. In such situations, give a direct but high-level answer to the question asked and get right back to your pitch. Analysis comes later.

So, how can we create an original phrase? One way is to use “Spell Chuck,” and discard the normal way of spelling things. For some reason, beauty salons seem to be very good at this: Consider Shear Genius, Curl up and Dye and Cut and Dried. Another way of creating an original phrase is to run your core words through the alphabet, from A to Z, and keep modifying the first syllable until you find something that corresponds with your idea or product. For example, the word entrepreneur can be transformed into a variety of trademarkable terms – a spiritual business owner could be a “Zenpreneur,” for example. You can extend this wordplay approach and try playing with the last syllable, or add a prefix (e.g., re-, multi-, pre-) or suffix (e.g., –ly, -ology, -ish) to your core words. For example, consider the new word re-newlyweds that describes couples who have renewed their wedding vows later in their marriage and are “wed” once more.

metaphors is to focus on the three A’s: Avocation (e.g., a hobby), Achievement and Adversity. To do this exercise, you need to take a fresh piece of paper and on it, draw three vertical lines. Use one column for avocations you are passionate about, one for your proudest achievements and one for all the adversities you have faced so far. Now look for similarities and connections between the columns. Can you create analogies and use past experiences to create stories that better explain what you’re trying to say? A good example of the power of this method is how a business executive used his flying lessons as an example to curb micromanaging in his company. He told his managers how his flying teacher never took the yoke out of his hands – not even in critical situations – but instead gave general instructions and let him figure it out. “Let them fly the plane” thus became an expression in the company for “stop micromanaging.”

Our rational brain doesn’t control our decisions. If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, you’ll see three areas. On the outside is the most recently evolved part, the neocortex. This is responsible for rational thought and language. The two middle sections make up the limbic brain. These are responsible for feelings like loyalty and trust, as well as decision-making.

His theory states that every population can be divided into five segments, each of which responds differently to innovation. Innovators, who make up 2.5 percent of the population, are the first to embrace novelty. The next 13.5 percent are early adopters. Then come the more risk-averse early majority and the late majority.

Maybe they’ve developed some exciting new product prototypes, or have managed to make your software 99-percent bug-free. Now ask yourself how they got there. Was it through increased collaborative efforts, or more solitary work? Was a new team leader onboarded? Are there more, or fewer, meetings? Are there more intradepartmental efforts?

Generally speaking, there are two big categories of questions. First, we have softball questions. Softball questions are easy questions that give your counterpart lots of room to answer and typically don’t aim at making a point. They are non-leading, meaning they include words like who, what, and when, allowing the questioned person to guide the direction of their answer. A good example of a non-leading, softball question is: “So, governor, what inspired you to run for office?”

Under capitalism, progress is becoming increasingly automated and predictable. For example, capitalist progress diminishes the figure of the business owner. Instead, it hands over control to an impersonal structure of managers, executives, and stockholders. In such a world, where running a business becomes an abstraction, why even try? As the cost of living increases, and as businesses focus on small niches, not revolutionary innovation, there’s less and less incentive for true entrepreneurial leadership.

A good example of antifragility is the story of the Hydra from Greek mythology. The Hydra was a many-headed serpent which tormented the ancient world. Each time one of these heads was cut off in battle, two would grow back in its place. So every time the beast was harmed, it benefitted; the Hydra was therefore antifragile.

seven separate behaviors that encourage trust, expressed together with the acronym BRAVING. BRAVING can be a useful way to inventory strengths and areas for improvement in working relationships with subordinates. So, what are these behaviors? The B stands for boundaries. This element of trust involves respecting others’ boundaries. If either party is unsure of the other’s boundaries, they ask whether or not something is okay, and the other person feels comfortable enough to say no if it isn’t. The R stands for reliability, or doing what we say we will. In a work context, this translates into being aware of our abilities and limitations so that we don’t end up overpromising and under-delivering on commitments. The A stands for accountability. We take ownership of our mistakes, apologize for them and try our best to make amends. The V stands for vault. We can think of ourselves as a vault of information that other people have shared with us over time. An important aspect of trust is not passing on information that is not ours to pass on. Other people need to trust that we will keep their confidences and also need to see that we are not sharing other’s confidential information with them. The I stands for integrity - choosing courage instead of comfort, and doing what is right rather than what is easy, fun or expedient. It also means practicing the same values that we preach. The N stands for non-judgment, which means people know that they can tell us how they really feel or ask for help without expecting us to judge them for doing so. The G stands for generosity, being consistently generous in our interpretation of the words, actions and intentions of others. People are more likely to trust us if they know we always see the best in others, rather than the worst.

The author, Simon Sinek, knows how to focus on the long term, but this HOW can be broken down – more precisely, Sinek focuses on creating products, services and ideas that will continue to be used long after he’s gone. It also means he’s less focused on deadlines and ways to make a quick profit, and more interested in building lasting momentum for his company.

Consequently, introverts have a strict moral conscience: they are aware of how their behavior affects others and tend to take their own mistakes to heart. To these highly sensitive individuals, it means a lot to be seen positively by others, which makes it unusually difficult for them to meet new people or be interviewed.

So what does she do while lecturing? She displays typically extroverted behavior: she takes long strides when she enters the room, speaks clearly and precisely during the lecture and maintains a nonchalant, relaxed posture. She can thus accomplish her goal; her students are captivated by her lectures and bombard her with requests for letters of recommendation. Classes proceed far more smoothly for her this way, too.

Extroverted team leaders, although successful in getting their team to adhere precisely to the rules and work by the book to achieve great performance levels, were less successful in responding to individuals’ suggestions – for example, how the T-shirts could be folded more quickly and efficiently. Among the introverted team leaders, the study showed the exact opposite. Although their calm, quiet character made it difficult for them to encourage their comrades and boost their efficiency level, they were more open to their team’s ideas and used all available means to put good suggestions into action.

Greens already tend to be fearful people. Much of their behavior is based on their fear of conflict and trying to avoid it. But they also tend to have fragile egos, and their capacity for self-criticism is strong enough without someone else chiming in. As a result, they can end up agreeing with your criticism so strongly that you start to feel sorry and backpedal. Don’t fall into this trap. Instead, make sure you’re clear that this isn’t anything personal – it’s just a friendly conversation about making some adjustments.

So the ‘Waiting For’ List is a cunning, stealth-like little tool that helps a Ninja get around the problem of other people and their unproductive mess. The idea is pretty simple: just keep a list tracking all of the people who are off doing things that you want to make sure actually get done. This allows you to track these items during the Review phase and chase as appropriate. The @Waiting folder in your email inbox, as featured in our earlier chapter on email, is simply the email equivalent of this. I use my Waiting For List to keep track of a whole myriad of items such as … Sales enquiries (‘John said he’d get back to me by the second week of January.’) Outstanding payments (‘Waiting on expense claim from client X.’) Personal reminders (‘Waiting on tickets for Wimbledon – being mailed in early May.’)

The really beautiful thing about your Weekly Checklist and Daily Checklist is that they separate thinking from doing. In these couple of hours a week, you cover the thinking, leaving the rest of the week for doing.

Calendar: what’s in my calendar today and are there any deadlines looming in the next three to five days? 2. Big Rocks: what would a good day of actions look like today? What would I like to have ticked off? What’s the one ‘big rock’ (or two or three) that needs some focus and mental heavy lifting? 3. Resistance: out of those tasks, which am I most likely to resist wanting to do? And why? (Once you’ve decided this, move this to first on your list for today and do it while you’re feeling fresh! How nice to know that once done, the day is easier from then on in, having done the hardest thing first!) We’ll talk more about big rocks and resistance in the next chapter. 4. Attention Management: out of those tasks, which of them require(s) the intense concentration of my proactive attention, and which can be done during inactive periods? (Use this question to start to shape the schedule of your day.) 5. Dependencies: are any of the things I’ve chosen time-dependent, people-dependent or resource-dependent? (In other words, is there a necessity as to when any of these tasks get done?)

STAGE 1. GET ALL OF MY INPUTS BACK TO ZERO Collect: Post, internal paperwork (check my desk, drawers, bag and anywhere else at this point) Notes from meetings Any expense receipts in my wallet/purse/bag? Get them into my in-tray Any other items? Add them to my in-tray. Capture ideas, thoughts, nags, worries and anything else. Think about: What’s been happening over the last week? What have I been working on? What projects are on my mind? Why? Conversations with my boss Conversations with my colleagues Conversations with my clients/customers/stakeholders Any family events or personal issues I need to manage.

STAGE 2. GET MY SECOND BRAIN UP TO DATE Calendar/Diary: Go through each appointment in my calendar for the last two weeks – are there any follow-ups I need to do? Go through the next three weeks of my calendar – any new actions here? If I have a paper-based calendar, make sure it has all the same appointments in it as my Outlook calendar! If there’s also a wall planner for the team in the office, do the same with this. Think further ahead in the diary and look for initial conversations, or where I need to make advanced travel plans like booking flights, booking rail tickets in advance and so on. Master Actions List: Check for completed items and cross them off. Read and ensure I have clarity about each action listed. Waiting For List: Are there any items on here that I’m no longer waiting for and can remove? Do the quick one- to two-minute emails to chase up any items that are now becoming urgent. Add anything that is going to take longer to chase to my Master Actions List. Projects List: Any projects that are finished or simply no longer need to happen? Any new projects to add? Do I have any additional projects kept somewhere else (such as a team project plan)? If so, add these to my Projects List so that I have everything in one place.

STAGE 3. THINK AHEAD Projects List: Go through each project in turn and make sure I have added new next physical actions to my Master Actions List. At the very least, ensure that I have one action on my Master Actions List that relates to each project. Think about the strategic level with each of these projects. What more is needed? Master Actions List: Decide on the main activity areas for the next week. Think about what my big priorities will be. What items need to be crossed out for next week to be judged a success? Make a reminder note in my calendar or mark the high-priority tasks. Which items will present a big challenge to my proactive attention? Schedule these in the diary specifically. Good Ideas Park: Anything here that I need to renegotiate and decide is now worth doing? Any new ideas to add? The Wider World: Check trade press or internal communications to see if there are any events or opportunities coming up this week. Anything interesting to write about or tie in to? Any school holidays or religious festivals coming up that might present opportunities or schedule changes?

STAGE 4. GET READY Packing and Preparing: What documents do I need for the next week? Get the printer running now! What files do I need for upcoming meetings? What reading materials do I need access to? What travel tickets do I need? If they’re already in the office, find them and add them to my bag, wallet or purse. Can I check in online right now? Can I look up the train times and make a quick note of them? People: Are there any conversations I need to have with people to ensure that they are prepared for the things happening next week? Drop quick emails to people confirming meetings or ask for more information in preparation for next week. Is there anyone (boss, assistant, colleague) who needs to know more about my schedule for next week? Attention Management: When are my best periods of proactive attention going to be? When am I likely to be exhausted, stressed or not at my best? Is there anything I can do now to support those times or minimize hassles?

STAGE 5. QUESTIONS Focus: Is anything on my Master Actions List so big or that will take so long that it would be better if broken up into chunks? Is there anything on my list that’s been hanging around for a few weeks? Do I need to redefine the action to give it more clarity? Ruthlessness: Delete three things from my Master Actions List simply because they’re not mission-critical. Let anyone else relevant know that I’m doing this (and my reason!). Delegate three things from my Master Actions List that someone else could just as easily do. Resistance: Is there anything here I’m resisting? What makes it/them challenging? What is going to give me the momentum I need? Could I cheat or move the goal posts? (Remember, unorthodoxy that gets the job done is fine!) What’s the smallest step forward I could take? How about just committing to that? Health & Fitness: Am I eating well? Am I drinking enough water? Am I getting the exercise I need? If not, where does this fit into my routine next week? Did I meditate or find time to completely switch off this week? When are my best opportunities to do that next week and how can I ensure they happen? How do I feel physically and emotionally? Are there any problems or issues I need to think about? Relationships: Am I spending enough time with family and friends? Am I happy when I do? If not, what would change this and how can I work towards it this week? Hobbies: Am I making time for hobbies? What’s coming up in the next week? Happiness: Am I happy, at least most of the time? What would make me happier right now? Listen to my soul here!

1. Once you’ve committed to a Power Hour, you can’t change the time or reschedule it (you wouldn’t reschedule a meeting at short notice with your boss, so why be more willing to let yourself down than you are to let down others?). 2. You can only have one Power Hour each day. The focus on consistently doing one thing well is what counts here. Trying to schedule seven Power Hours a day just leads to stress and disappointment, so don’t even try.

Well, NLP offers a three-step technique to create new, positive anchors that can help you get through difficult situations. The first step is to think of the emotional state you want to be in. Happy, energetic, calm – pick your ideal state and keep it in mind. The second step is to think of a moment from your past when you were in this state. Perhaps you felt it when you passed an important test, or when your first child was born. Whatever it may be, hold on to that moment. The third and final step is to think of the sound or movement that you want to associate with this emotional state. It could be anything from a certain Elvis Presley song to a certain hand gesture, like a thumbs-up.

Some teams are spread across geographical boundaries, making contact more infrequent and more problematic, or entirely virtual in nature. The timescales within which teams are expected to join, form, and perform to meet a business challenge are shorter than ever before. The business challenges themselves have increased in complexity.

So what is vision as a leadership quality? It can be broken down into two parts. The first is the ability to “envision” and dream; that is, to create a clear and bold image of how the leader wants things to be in the long term without the impediment of conventional limits. This includes depth in terms of a lengthy timescale and breadth in terms of a whole-systems mindset, making connections beyond boundaries. The second part of vision is the ability to communicate this image in such a way as to inspire others – to be “visionary.” It is through the communication of vision and the resulting inspiration that followership is created, for what is a leader without followers?

ACTIVITY: Exercise Your Agility For one week at first – watch out, it may later become a habit – each day try to avoid repetition in every little thing you do, from the smallest to the greatest. List all the things you still did habitually and change them the following week. Greet people with the truth rather than a gratuitous platitude, ask taxi drivers about their interests, visit people in an old people’s home, pick up rubbish in the hedgerow, talk to the busking musician or the street beggar and give £5 instead of 50p. Think of a food you would never order, and eat it anyway.

A businessperson may be focused on personal achievement and success in the material world and may have become a well-integrated person, a good parent, and a respected member of society, without ever having asked themselves a meaningful question about life. The businessperson might regard the opposite type as lazy, disorganized, a sponger, a dilettante. The opposite type of person leads a contemplative and ascetic life, but seems ill equipped to cope with the realities and essentials of the everyday world. Their home, their finances, and even their personality may be in a bit of a mess. These people live a monastic life of study or art, and readily give gentle assistance to others. They see the businessperson’s pursuits as pointless, ego driven, and often destructive to themselves and to others.

If social pressures, business imperatives, or blind determination to achieve override the tension that is attempting to pull us back on track, we are liable eventually to run into a wake-up wall. This wall is known as the crisis of meaning (Figure 21). When we hit the crisis wall, we tend to bounce back in shock into temporary confusion and even performance regression for a while, but at the same time we are likely eventually to be pulled upward toward the ideal to discover a more balanced path. We may become more introspective, paint or write poetry, and want to spend more quality time with our children.

When coachees are comfortable with you, you should be able to ask them to list some names (Chocoholic, Hero, Victim, and so on) for their subpersonalities. Many coaching questions evolve from that point: Which one of these do you find most disruptive? Under what circumstances does this one show up? Give me an example of a recent time. What did it want at that time? Did it get it? And if so, how do you think the other person felt? What would be another way of getting what you want in those circumstances?

Imagine a hot summer’s day. You’re standing in your kitchen holding a lemon you’ve taken from the fridge. Look at the outside of it, its yellow, waxy skin with green marks at the ends. Feel how cold it is in your hand. Raise it to your nose and smell it. Mmmm. Press it gently and notice the weight of the lemon in the palm of your hand. Now take a knife and cut it in half. Hear the juices start to run and notice that the smell is stronger now. Bite deeply into the lemon and allow the juice to swirl around in your mouth. Words have the power to trigger your saliva glands. Hear the word ‘lemon’ and your brain kicks into action. The word tells your brain that you have a lemon in your hand. You may think that words only describe meanings, but in fact they create your reality – a concept we explore throughout this book.

In their work, Bandler and Grinder also drew upon the skills of linguists Alfred Korzybski and Noam Chomsky, social anthropologist Gregory Bateson and psychotherapist Paul Watzlawick.

This presupposition is known as the Law of Requisite Variety and derives from systems theory. This law was formulated by Ross Ashby, an English psychiatrist who was also a pioneer in the field of cybernetics. Put very simply, the Law of Requisite Variety means the ability of a person within a system to succeed is directly proportional to the level of flexibility of behaviour that person chooses to exhibit.

the first presuppositions is that ‘the map is not the territory’. This statement was published in Science and Sanity in 1933 by Korzybski, a Polish count and mathematician. Korzybski was referring to the fact that you experience the world through your senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste) – the territory. You then take this external phenomenon, pass it through your mental filters (Chapter 3 tells you more) such as your values, beliefs and life experiences and make an internal representation (IR) of it within your brain – the map.

Think about this part as being responsible for breathing and all the basic physical reflexes necessary for survival. Mammalian or limbic brain: The home of the reticular activating system (see the ‘Tracking Information: Your Reticular Activating System’ section later in this chapter) and the amygdala, host to emotional responses including fear, stress and love, and the reward system that gets a kick out of risky behaviours. Think of this part of your brain as the instinctive, emotional element.

The first human footprint on a sandy Australian beach was immediately washed away by the waves. Yet when the invaders advanced inland, they left behind a different footprint, one that would never be expunged. As they pushed on, they encountered a strange universe of unknown creatures that included a 200-kilogram, two-metre kangaroo, and a marsupial lion, as massive as a modern tiger, that was the continent’s largest predator. Koalas far too big to be cuddly and cute rustled in the trees and flightless birds twice the size of ostriches sprinted on the plains. Dragon-like lizards and snakes five metres long slithered through the undergrowth. The giant diprotodon, a two-and-a-half-ton wombat, roamed the forests. Except for the birds and reptiles, all these animals were marsupials – like kangaroos, they gave birth to tiny, helpless, fetus-like young which they then nurtured with milk in abdominal pouches.

According to one theory, insect wings evolved millions of years ago from body protrusions on flightless bugs. Bugs with bumps had a larger surface area than those without bumps, and this enabled them to absorb more sunlight and thus stay warmer. In a slow evolutionary process, these solar heaters grew larger. The same structure that was good for maximum sunlight absorption – lots of surface area, little weight – also, by coincidence, gave the insects a bit of a lift when they skipped and jumped. Those with bigger protrusions could skip and jump further. Some insects started using the things to glide, and from there it was a small step to wings that could actually propel the bug through the air.

Polytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single power or law governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist religions recognised such a supreme power that stands behind all the different gods, demons and holy rocks. In classical Greek polytheism, Zeus, Hera, Apollo and their colleagues were subject to an omnipotent and all-encompassing power – Fate (Moira, Ananke).

The big breakthrough came with Christianity. This faith began as an esoteric Jewish sect that sought to convince Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was their long-awaited messiah. However, one of the sect’s first leaders, Paul of Tarsus, reasoned that if the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, and if He had bothered to incarnate Himself in the flesh and to die on the cross for the salvation of humankind, then this is something everyone should hear about, not just Jews.

Chaotic systems come in two shapes. Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts. Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system. What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise.

How exactly did the Dutch win the trust of the financial system? Firstly, they were sticklers about repaying their loans on time and in full, making the extension of credit less risky for lenders. Secondly, their country’s judicial system enjoyed independence and protected private rights – in particular private property rights. Capital trickles away from dictatorial states that fail to defend private individuals and their property. Instead, it flows into states upholding the rule of law and private property.

There are many types of steam engines, but they all share one common principle. You burn some kind of fuel, such as coal, and use the resulting heat to boil water, producing steam. As the steam expands it pushes a piston. The piston moves, and anything that is connected to the piston moves with it. You have converted heat into movement!

In the year 2000, wars caused the deaths of 310,000 individuals, and violent crime killed another 520,000. Each and every victim is a world destroyed, a family ruined, friends and relatives scarred for life. Yet from a macro perspective these 830,000 victims comprised only 1.5 per cent of the 56 million people who died in 2000. That year 1.26 million people died in car accidents (2.25 per cent of total mortality) and 815,000 people committed suicide (1.45 per cent).4 The figures for 2002 are even more surprising. Out of 57 million dead, only 172,000 people died in war and 569,000 died of violent crime (a total of 741,000 victims of human violence). In contrast, 873,000 people committed suicide.

while the price of war soared, its profits declined. For most of history, polities could enrich themselves by looting or annexing enemy territories. Most wealth consisted of material things like fields, cattle, slaves and gold, so it was easy to loot it or occupy it. Today, wealth consists mainly of human capital and organisational know-how. Consequently it is difficult to carry it off or conquer it by military force.

Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. People with strong families who live in tight-knit and supportive communities are significantly happier than people whose families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part of. Marriage is particularly important. Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being, and between bad marriages and misery.

For example, evolution provided pleasant feelings as rewards to males who spread their genes by having sex with fertile females. If sex were not accompanied by such pleasure, few males would bother. At the same time, evolution made sure that these pleasant feelings quickly subsided. If orgasms were to last for ever, the very happy males would die of hunger for lack of interest in food, and would not take the trouble to look for additional fertile females.

Buddha agreed with modern biology and New Age movements that happiness is independent of external conditions. Yet his more important and far more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings. Indeed, the more significance we give our feelings, the more we crave them, and the more we suffer. Buddha’s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings.

Better living through logotherapy: A few key ideas ▪ We don’t create the meaning of our life, as Sartre claimed—we discover it. ▪ We each have a unique reason for being, which can be adjusted or transformed many times over the years. ▪ Just as worry often brings about precisely the thing that was feared, excessive attention to a desire (or “hyper-intention”) can keep that desire from being fulfilled. ▪ Humor can help break negative cycles and reduce anxiety. ▪ We all have the capacity to do noble or terrible things. The side of the equation we end up on depends on our decisions, not on the condition in which we find ourselves.

The four phases of Morita therapy Morita’s original treatment, which lasts fifteen to twenty-one days, consists of the following stages: 1. Isolation and rest (five to seven days). During the first week of treatment, the patient rests in a room without any external stimuli. No television, books, family, friends, or speaking. All the patient has is his thoughts. He lies down for most of the day and is visited regularly by the therapist, who tries to avoid interacting with him as much as possible. The therapist simply advises the patient to continue observing the rise and fall of his emotions as he lies there. When the patient gets bored and wants to start doing things again, he is ready to move on to the next stage of therapy. 2. Light occupational therapy (five to seven days). In this stage, the patient performs repetitive tasks in silence. One of these is keeping a diary about his thoughts and feelings. The patient goes outside after a week of being shut in, takes walks in nature, and does breathing exercises. He also starts doing simple activities, such as gardening, drawing, or painting. During this stage, the patient is still not allowed to talk to anyone, except the therapist. 3. Occupational therapy (five to seven days). In this stage, the patient performs tasks that require physical movement. Dr. Morita liked to take his patients to the mountains to chop wood. In addition to physical tasks, the patient is also immersed in other activities, such as writing, painting, or making ceramics. The patient can speak with others at this stage, but only about the tasks at hand. 4. The return to social life and the “real” world. The patient leaves the hospital and is reintroduced to social life, but maintains the practices of meditation and occupational therapy developed during treatment. The idea is to reenter society as a new person, with a sense of purpose, and without being controlled by social or emotional pressures.

A table featuring red peppers, carrots, spinach, cauliflower, and eggplant, for example, offers great color and variety. Vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and soy products such as tofu are the staples of an Okinawan’s diet. More than 30 percent of their daily calories comes from vegetables. ▪ Grains are the foundation of their diet. Japanese people eat white rice every day, sometimes adding noodles. Rice is the primary food in Okinawa, as well. ▪ They rarely eat sugar, and if they do, it’s cane sugar. We drove through several sugarcane fields every morning on our way to Ogimi, and even drank a glass of cane juice at Nakijin Castle. Beside the stall selling the juice was a sign describing the anticarcinogenic benefits of sugarcane.

Okinawans consume, in general, one-third as much sugar as the rest of Japan’s population, which means that sweets and chocolate are much less a part of their diet. ▪ They also eat practically half as much salt as the rest of Japan: 7 grams per day, compared to an average of 12. ▪ They consume fewer calories: an average of 1,785 per day, compared to 2,068 in the rest of Japan. In fact, low caloric intake is common among the five Blue Zones.

Shikuwasa is the citrus fruit par excellence of Okinawa, and Ogimi is its largest producer in all of Japan. The fruit is extremely acidic: It is impossible to drink shikuwasa juice without diluting it first with water. Its taste is somewhere between that of a lime and a mandarin orange, to which it bears a family resemblance. Shikuwasas also contain high levels of nobiletin, a flavonoid rich in antioxidants.

“Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where it can get burned off, slow down. And after two hours, good cholesterol drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things going again. These things are so simple they’re almost stupid,”

resilience? One thing that everyone with a clearly defined ikigai has in common is that they pursue their passion no matter what. They never give up, even when the cards seem stacked against them or they face one hurdle after another. We’re talking about resilience, a concept that has become influential among psychologists. But resilience isn’t just the ability to persevere. As we’ll see in this chapter, it is also an outlook we can cultivate to stay focused on the important things in life rather than what is most urgent, and to keep ourselves from being carried away by negative emotions. In the final section of the chapter, we’ll explore techniques that go beyond resilience to cultivate antifragility. Sooner or later, we all have to face difficult moments, and the way we do this can make a huge difference to our quality of life. Proper training for our mind, body, and emotional resilience is essential for confronting life’s ups and downs. Nana

In order to keep their minds virtuous, the Stoics practiced something like negative visualization: They imagined the worst thing that could happen in order to be prepared if certain privileges and pleasures were taken from them. To practice negative visualization, we have to reflect on negative events, but without worrying about them.

Worrying about things that are beyond our control accomplishes nothing. We should have a clear sense of what we can change and what we can’t, which in turn will allow us to resist giving in to negative emotions.
